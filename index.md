# Welcome to the Obsidian Wiki for StracciaD&D! 
Here you'll not only find information about characters and locations, but also a massive under construction sign; there is a lot still to do and fill out, so please ignore some of the half-complete pages. It is on my [[TODO List StracciaD&D|To-do list]].

> [!warning]
> **This place is ridled with spoilers, as there is no filtering in place yet for what makes it onto the site or not. Characters are safe, but thread with caution.**
