The following is a first draft of a potential setting, including the physical locations, short history, and inhabitants and their society
# Overview

## Setting
The planet of PLACEHOLDER is home to a cluster of known and unknown species of humanoids collectively known as [[#Kin]]. It's landscape is a blend of sculpted and untamed areas, depending on the Kinling that occupy it and their goals or needs, but most of it is covered in mountainous terrain. ...

## The Kin
The Kin are the sentient human-like species, that have their physical manifestation as a defining trait. Some kin stay relatively small, while others grow to immense proportions. There is no exact science to this, but the kin keep to a practice they call '[[#Manifestation]]' to shape their bodies, each species of kin adopting their own methods of Manifesting. 
There are several species and subspecies of Kin (not entirely worked out) that can interbreed. Each species is called a Kinling, and each Kinling has defining traits, though their societies aren't necessarily tied to their species. Most Kinling are defined by a combination of their biome of origin, and physical characteristics. ...
