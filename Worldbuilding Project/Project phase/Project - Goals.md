# Why am I doing this?
I'm stuck with the following options:

1. **Fitting it into guidelines and pre-set creations.** 
	1. Example: Creating a Dungeons & Dragons 5th Edition / OneD&D Universe for all future campaigns.
	2. Currently my main motivation for typing this, but do consider that this means its only use will be in my own D&D campaigns.
2. **Creating an original world from an existing concept or genre.**
	1. Example: Sci-Fi, Fantasy, Grimdark, Post-Apocalyptic.
	2. Probably has the most legs as I can still go whatever direction I want, and can be used for load of things in the future.

# What am I going to do?
This project is going to be an original world as designed and created by myself, for no particular purpose but to host stories that can only be told in this world. Though I am looking to divert from genres as much as possible, they will of course crop up as much as possible.

## Why pt. 2
The way I see it, creating a wholly custom universe serves many purposes:
- Joy and fun
- Showcasing and portfolio
- Practice
- Future endeavours (Books or games if it ever comes that far)
- Telling stories that cannot be told in other worlds

Once a world has been established, it is ready for stories to be created. Most likely I'll do this in a Silmarillion-type situation (though I don't particularly like that book); **I imagine writing a world *using* stories as examples, and picking several to write fleshed out stories or maybe even Novella's.** The least I want to get out of it is a medium through which I can experiment or tell tales.

## How & What
1. I am going to kick off this entire ordeal with a brainstorm. I need to brainstorm an absolute ton of stuff before committing to creation itself, just to filter out all the inspiration and other bogus. See 0. Master Checklist - Brainstorm.
2. The brainstorm ends with a rough outline of the primary location, atmosphere, and significance of the project. It very roughly answers the main why's, how's, and perhaps who's.
3. A midpoint is probably the best course of action after that; somewhere after the dust of the creation myth('s) has settled, but before culture!
4. It might then come down to creating the endpoints of different cultures, and filling in the blanks where they appear. Right now is probably the time for a nice map!
