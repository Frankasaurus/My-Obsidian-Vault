The **White Lodge** is shared 'seat' of the Gods, and allows them to be everywhere at once. It does not exist in reality. Ascendancy to the Lodge is the highest level of Ascendancy possible for a soul. It allows a soul to exert immense influence over multiple plains, mainly those of their domain, including the Material Plane of [[Califhen]].
# Overview
The White Lodge is considered the highest power in Califhen, with the exception of Space, Time, Fate, and Blood[^1]. Within the Lodge are Titles that souls from mortal forms ascend to upon achieving 'Balance of the Four Truths', the process of which is undefined. Titles are established and abolished as the Lodge itself deems necessary, and can be fought over or die out. Titles serve as designations within which the God acts and watches over the universe. A title is most commonly occupied by a single soul, but can in rare occassions be occupied by up to three souls.

When a soul reaches Godhood, they become incorporeal, near-indestructable, unbound, and immortal. Their ascendancy is broadcast in a way they see fit, but felt by all those faithful to the title, if it was previously occupied. The God will often reign over their own Realm within the Astral Plane, where they shape and mold their perfect world as a blueprint for the Material realm. Old or destroyed gods leave behind their realm ungoverned and unmaintained, often falling into ruin.

[^1]: Space, Time, Fate, and Blood are collectively called Immateria, The Four Truths, or The Four Facts
