The **Free State of Cogastr** is an island nation off the coast of the Tuon Peninsula. It used to be a barbaric nation and major exporter of rare minerals, until it was overthrown by Leeflin Brut.
# Description
Cogastr is an island that sits to the East of the Tuon Peninsula, between the Cohyn- and Naryn Sea. Near the southern shore, large stone prisons housed captive workers that mined for rare minerals, gems, and other treasures of the earth in the central and Northern regions of the island. The western area houses a single major port. Housing for the nation's actual inhabitants is spread throughout the land, mostly centered on the central-northern plains. 

The only unexplored of the island is the less hospitable North. A large volcanic mountain disallows easy access, and rumors of ancient dormant civilizations keep most of the populace from exploring it.
# History
The ancient earth of Cogastr is said to have been blessed with riches and minerals, though its long-extinct volanco also attributed to its varried and fertile soil. The island of Cogastr enjoyed wild fauna for most of its existance after the volcano died, where animals thrived due to a lack of major natural predators. Combined with other factors such as the water and air around the area, allowed for the island to become bountyful in many resources, which was first exploited by sailors from Tenir making landfal in what the initially thought to be the Tuon Peninsula. 

When settlements started growing, and nations started battling for the island, it soon became clear that it was extremely hard to conquer. It often remained untouched and only switched sides in later settlements between warring nations. After several stints of independance, Leopold Gerrdruck - a treasurer with knowledge on its resources - secretly informed his family to exploit these sites and got rich. This bought them influence, and eventually control over the Cogastr, which then swiftly turned itself into a barbaric state of exploiters. Leopold Gerrdruck did not see the need to build an expensive army, and kept any daring conquerers at bay with bribes and trade agreements, eventually resulting in Cogastr importing swathes of prisoners to work the mines, for cheaper prices in return. Cogastr soon monopolised the mineral trade in the Naryn Sea, and became rich and influential. 

Generations later, the first succesful uprising by the anarchistic warband Leeflin Brut (with help from the [[Party (C3)]]) led to the execution of most of Cogastr's leadership - including the Gerrdruk bloodline. With the immediate threath of retaliations from nations that relied on the islands minerals looming, Eileen Leeflin placed the island under a state of emergency, and is prepparing its population for the worst, all the while subjecting the previous inhabitants.
