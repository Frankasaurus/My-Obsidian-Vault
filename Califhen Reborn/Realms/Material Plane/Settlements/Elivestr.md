The Duchy of **Elivestr** is a port city on the Eastern coast of the Tuon Peninsula, and is the capital city of **Vreebis**. 
# City Description
The city is built on a cliff that runs down the coast, though it has multiple ravines running accross it. The highest and most coastal district is the Citadel, with each next district being lower down the cliff. Elivestr's architecture consists out of wood and red granite, and buildings are often colorful and accented, especially in the wealthier historical districts. It's main exports include books & maps, and mystical creations & teachings.  

Its government - The Waxen Court - is run by intelectuals and guild leaders, who elect a Duke that determines the course of the city. The guilds each run their own Trade accross the entire city region, and support each other in their ventures, passing suggestions around before presenting them to the Duke, who passes approvals and handles communication.
# History
More than 400 years ago, Elivestr was found by refugees from the North during a particularly frightening winter, who were looking for a more hospitable climate to live in. They would eventually settle in a place that was said to be revealed by the then-Hearthfather Keder with a "glistening ray of light that scorched the earth with warmth and hospitality". The Kederfire Square still marks this spot today. The new population slowly attracted followers of the Heartfather and other refugees seeking a place to call home, and it grew to a place of worship. A war in the area led to The Burning of the Sea, where most of the Cohyn coast was ransacked and set ablaze by opportunistic bandits. Those same bandits replaced much of Elivestr's population, with most of the population only returning after the Burning had ended, with little of their original homes remaining. The groundworks for Elivestr's Guild system was founded here, as the new and old settlers agreed on terms that would see both parties control that which they were best at; the old zealots would focus on the population, and the reformed bandits held order and traveled the lands. 

This power-duo of one Guild facilitating the commerce of another was slowly expanded upon with more organisations, and through cooperation the population grew. Though the reformed were the old zealots that would swing the scepter for most of Elivestr's original growth, slowly turning the city from a holy shite to a center of broader education to accomodate its melting pot after the war. This led to the Hearthfather District growing, and formally becoming the first walled-in part of the city. With it's main export acquired, Elivestr started trading, growing, and attracting scholars and businessmen.

Over centuries, Elivestr rarely chose sides as an intellectual hub, but often supplied several warring parties in the region with their mystical supplies, and therefor went relatively untouched over the years. It has signed many treaties that subjegate itself to a kingdom or empire mostly to keep them of their back, but has always been able to keep its own power in these. The most recent decades have seen a shift in this mentality, however; the Kingdom of Vreebis is now centered on Elivestr, whose peaveful population grows frustrated at its needless wars funded by the rich. On all sides, attempts at coup's have been taking place, and though slowly, the city is starting to stagnate. A vicious few months have led to the Duke being expelled. With an empty throne, the influential [[Kaurius Krone]] has brought forth drastic measures to change Elivestr's struggling government to one ruled by Houses and Nobles, adding even more noise to the chaos. With the city now a ticking time-bomb, and its largest importing partner [[Cogastr]] going through its own crisis, it will be a matter of time before Elivestr will blow. 
# Points of Interest
**The Eyrie**
Built relatively late in Elivestr's history, this windy cliffside is the most developed area of the city. The most important buildings are often housed here, scattered inbetween places of worship and accomodations for bigger estates, such as some of the houses.
- **The Royal Estate:** One of the homes to King Peldr and the Vreebis' Royal family.
- **The Waxen Court:** Home to the governance of Elivestr.

**Guild District**
When Elivestr's Guilds started coming to life, most settled around each other to improve communication. Though modestly maintained, it is a varied area, from wide bustling streets to narrow dusty alleys.
- **Elsenburgh-Doorne Residency:** Home of [[Lenora]] and the rest of the Von Elsenburgh-Doorne family.
- ***"The Talon"* Guild of Justice & Security:** Takes care of the city's guards, crime, justice, and patrols. Run by [[Wilmar von Elsenburgh Doorne]].
- ***"Pursuit of the Owl"* Guild of Economy & Interstate Commerce:** Former employer of [[Herman]].
- ***"Halfclock"* Guild of Arcana & Spellwriting:** Former employer of [[Nyrin]] & [[Yerall]]'s parents.
- ***"Goldfield"* Guild of Agriculture & Food Safety**

**Hearthfather District (of Learning)**
The Hearthfather District is where Elivestr was founded, and maintains its original purpose - to focus and study. Some of the oldest buildings in the city are the university buildings of this are, though little of the living quarters remain today.
- **University of Law** 
- **University of Literature**
- **University of Geography** 
- **Minor universities.**
- **Kederfire Square:** the origin of Elivestr's founding.

**Craft & Trade District**
Housing Elivestr's port, this area is centered on the final stretch of the river Eli, where it cuts the cliffside in two before exiting in the Cohyn Sea. The cranes and scaffolding that move cargo from the docks to the inner city fills the skyline, and blocks out a lot of light to the port. The remainder of this area is full of warehouses and big blocks of living spaces.

**Edge District**
Though once an up-and-coming area, this has now become the new home for expelled citizens during [[Kaurius Krone|Kaurius Krone's]] reign. 

**Rural region**
The wider area that surrounds Elivestr is maintained quite a lot due to its relatively exposed position. Farms, military lookouts, sprawling settlements and obscure services are scattered throughout its domain.
- **[[Herman's Farm]]:** Besides a semi-productive farm, it is a reception centre for troublesome kids that Elivestr doesn't want to deal with. It came about as a deal between the Goldfield guild and Herman.
- **Stonemorn:** Formerly a village landinward of Elivestr, but the construction of the lucrative ports caused the water level to rise and subjected the village to frequent flooding. It lies abandoned in the middle of a bog since.
