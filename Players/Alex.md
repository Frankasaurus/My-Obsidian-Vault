**Alex** is the Dungeon Master in the Sukkelberg D&D Tabletop group.

I am your God.

Long may I reign.
# Tools of the Trade
Here are the main tools Alex' uses to create his D&D campaigns & worlds.
1. **[Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/)** - Notation app, and the core of my D&D worldbuilding and preparing. I also publish it using the [Quartz](https://quartz.jzhao.xyz/) framework on Github Pages.
2. [**Wonderdraft**](https://www.wonderdraft.net/) - Regional map making tool.
3. [**D&DBeyond's Encounter tool**](https://www.dndbeyond.com/encounter-builder) - The best place to look for balanced encounters and monsters to use.
4. [**Canvas of Kings**](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2498570/Canvas_of_Kings/) - City map making tool.
5. **[D&D Shop Catalog](https://www.reddit.com/r/DnD/comments/m8w8c6/updated_more_inclusive_5e_dd_shops_catalog_v201/)** - Making shopping episodes bearable.

Generation tools:
1. [Armoria](https://azgaar.github.io/Armoria/) - Coat of Arms generator.
2. [Fantasy Name Generator](https://www.fantasynamegenerators.com/) - Though I mainly make up my own names considering what I want to represent in the culture, it's still super useful.
3. [Azgaarâ€™s Fantasy Map Generator](https://azgaar.github.io/Fantasy-Map-Generator/) & [Watabou's Medieval Fantasy City Generator](https://watabou.itch.io/medieval-fantasy-city-generator) - For inspiration in the early stages of map making.
4. The real world - It's crazy out there.
