***Hailing from a strange and distant land, wandering tabaxi are catlike humanoids driven by curiosity to collect interesting artifacts, gather tales and stories, and lay eyes on all the world's wonders. Ultimate travelers, the inquisitive tabaxi rarely stay in one place for long. Their innate nature pushes them to leave no secrets uncovered, no treasures or legends lost.***

### **Cat's Talent**
You have proficiency in the Perception and Stealth skills.
### **Darkvision**
You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You discern colors in that darkness only as shades of gray.
### **Feline Agility**
Your reflexes and agility allow you to move with a burst of speed. When you move on your turn in combat, you can double your speed until the end of the turn. Once you use this trait, you can’t use it again until you move 0 feet on one of your turns.
### **Languages** 
Your character can speak, read, and write Common and one other language that you and your DM agree is appropriate for the character. The [[Player's Handbook]] offers a list of languages to choose from. The DM is free to modify that list for a campaign.
