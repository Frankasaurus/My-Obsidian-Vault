**Forest gnomes and rock gnomes are the gnomes most commonly encountered in the lands of the surface world. There is another subrace of gnomes rarely seen by any surface-dweller: deep gnomes, also known as svirfneblin. Guarded, and suspicious of outsiders, svirfneblin are cunning and taciturn, but can be just as kind-hearted, loyal, and compassionate as their surface cousins.**

# Svirfneblin Traits
*Source: [[Mordenkainen's Monsters of the Multiverse]]*
### **Ability Score Increase** 
When determining your character’s ability scores, increase one score by 2 and increase a different score by 1, or increase three different scores by 1. You can't raise any of your scores above 20.
*Standard scores are Intelligence +2, and Dexterity +1.*
### **Creature Type**
You are a Humanoid. You are also considered a gnome for any prerequisite or effect that requires you to be a gnome.
### **Size**
Your size is small.
### **Speed**
Your base walking speed is 30 feet.
### Darkvision
You can see in dim light within 120 feet of you as if it were bright light and in darkness as if it were dim light. You discern colors in that darkness only as shades of gray.
### Gift of the Svirfneblin
Starting at 3rd level, you can cast the [[Disguise Self]] spell with this trait. Starting at 5th level, you can also cast the [[Nondetection]] spell with it, without requiring a material component. Once you cast either of these spells with this trait, you can’t cast that spell with it again until you finish a long rest. You can also cast these spells using spell slots you have of the appropriate level.
- Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma is your spellcasting ability for these spells when you cast them with this trait (choose when you select this race).

### Gnomish Magic Resistance
You have advantage on Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma saving throws against spells.
### Svirfneblin Camouflage
When you make a Dexterity (Stealth) check, you can make the check with advantage. You can use this trait a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.
### **Language**
Your character can speak, read, and write Common and one other language that you and your DM agree is appropriate for the character. The [[Player's Handbook]] offers a list of languages to choose from. The DM is free to modify that list for a campaign.
*Standard languages are Common, Aarakocra, and Auran.*
