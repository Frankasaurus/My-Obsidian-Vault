***The Feywild is home to many fantastic peoples, including fairies. Fairies are a wee folk, but not nearly as much so as their pixie and sprite friends. The first fairies spoke Elvish, Goblin, or Sylvan, and encounters with human visitors prompted many of them to learn Common as well.***

### Age
Fairies and have a life span of about a century.
### Creature Type
You are a Fey.
### Size
You are Small.
### Speed
Your walking speed is 30 feet.
### Fairy Magic
You know the [[Druidcraft]] cantrip. Starting at 3rd level, you can cast the [[Faerie Fire]] spell with this trait. Starting at 5th level, you can also cast the [[Enlarge/Reduce]] spell with this trait. Once you cast faerie fire or enlarge/reduce with this trait, you can’t cast that spell with it again until you finish a long rest. You can also cast either of those spells using any spell slots you have of the appropriate level.
- Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma is your spellcasting ability for these spells when you cast them with this trait (choose when you select this race).
### Flight
Because of your wings, you have a flying speed equal to your walking speed. You can’t use this flying speed if you’re wearing medium or heavy armor.
