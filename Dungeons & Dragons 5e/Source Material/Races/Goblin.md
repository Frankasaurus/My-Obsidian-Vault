***A subterranean folk, goblins can be found in every corner of the multiverse, often beside their Goblin and hobgoblin kin. Long before the god Maglubiyet conquered them, early goblins served in the court of the Queen of Air and Darkness, one of the Feywild’s archfey. Goblins thrived in her dangerous domain thanks to a special boon from her—a supernatural knack for finding the weak spots in foes larger than themselves and for getting out of trouble. Goblins brought this fey boon with them to worlds across the Material Plane, even if they don’t remember the fey realm they inhabited before Maglubiyet’s rise. Now many goblins pursue their own destinies, escaping the plots of both archfey and gods.***

Your size is Small.
### **Speed** 
Your walking speed is 30 feet.
### **Darkvision** 
You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light and in darkness as if it were dim light. You discern colors in that darkness only as shades of gray.
### **Fey Ancestry** 
You have advantage on saving throws you make to avoid or end the charmed condition on yourself.
### **Fury of the Small**
When you damage a creature with an attack or a spell and the creature’s size is larger than yours, you can cause the attack or spell to deal extra damage to the creature. The extra damage equals your proficiency bonus.

### **Nimble Escape**
You can take the Disengage or Hide action as a bonus action on each of your turns.
### **Languages** 
Your character can speak, read, and write Common and one other language that you and your DM agree is appropriate for the character. The [[Player's Handbook]] offers a list of languages to choose from. The DM is free to modify that list for a campaign.
