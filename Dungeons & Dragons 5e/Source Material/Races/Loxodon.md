***The humanoid elephants called loxodons are often oases of calm. They hum or chant in sonorous tones and move slowly or sit in perfect stillness. If provoked to action, loxodons are true terrors—bellowing with rage, trumpeting and flapping their ears. Their serene wisdom, fierce loyalty, and unwavering conviction are tremendous assets to their guilds.***

# Loxodon Traits
*Source: [[Guildmaster's Guide to Ravnica]]*
### Ability Score Increase
Your Constitution score increases by 2, and your Wisdom score increases by 1.
### Age
Loxodons mature at the same rate as humans, however, they are considered mature by their people at 60 years old. Their lifespan can be as long as 450 years.
### Size
Loxodons are between 7 and 8 feet (≈2.5 meters) tall and weigh between 300(130kg) and 400 pounds(181kg). Your size is Medium.
### Speed
Your base walking speed is 30ft.
### Powerful Build
You count as one size larger when determining your carrying capacity and the weight you can push, drag, or lift.
### Loxodon Serenity
You have advantage against being charmed or frightened.
### Natural Armor
You have thick, leathery skin. When you aren't wearing armor, your AC is 12 + your Constitution modifier. You can use your natural armor to determine your AC if the armor you wear would leave you with a lower AC. A shield's benefits apply as normal while you use your natural armor.
### Trunk
You can grasp things with your trunk, and you can use it as a snorkel. It has a reach of 5 feet, and it can lift a number of pounds equal to five times your Strength score. You can use it to do the following simple tasks: lift, drop, hold, push, or pull an object or a creature; open or close a door or a container; grapple someone; or make an unarmed strike. Your DM might allow other simple tasks to be added to that list of options. It can't wield weapons or shields or do anything that requires manual precision, such as using tools or magic items or performing the somatic components of a spell.
### Keen Smell
Thanks to your sensitive trunk, you have advantage on Wisdom (Perception), Wisdom (Survival), and Intelligence (Investigation) checks that involve smell.
### Languages
You can speak, read, and write Common and Loxodon.
