***Tracing their ancestry to the genies of the Elemental Planes, each genasi can tap into the power of one of the elements. Air, earth, fire, and water — these are the four pillars of the Material Plane and the four types of genasi. Some genasi are direct descendants of a genie, while others were born to non-genasi parents who lived near a place suffused by a genie’s magic.***

> [!info]
> ***The [[#Genasi Traits|revised version]] (from [[Mordenkainen's Monsters of the Multiverse]]) is listed first, and the [[#Genasi Traits (legacy)|legacy]] (from [[Elemental Evil Player's Companion]]) is listed second.***
> *These variants are nearly identical, save for some of the wording.* 

> [!warning]
> The Genasi race was technically split up into four seperate races in [[Mordenkainen's Monsters of the Multiverse]]. Since only the element-related traits change and none of the other stats, this page will treat the variants as Subclasses.

## Air Genasi
*Source: [[Mordenkainen's Monsters of the Multiverse]]*
Air genasi are descended from djinn, the genies of the Elemental Plane of Air. Embodying many of the airy traits of their otherworldly ancestors, air genasi can draw upon their connection to the winds.
### Appearance
Air genasi’s skin tones include many shades of blue, along with the full range of human skin tones, with bluish or ashen casts. Sometimes their skin is marked by lines that seem like cracks with bluish-white energy spilling out. An air genasi’s hair might blow in a phantom wind or be made entirely of clouds or vapor.

You can hold your breath indefinitely while you’re not incapacitated.

### Appearance
An earth genasi’s skin can be the colors of stone and earth or a human skin tone with glittering sparkles like gem dust. Some earth genasi have lines marking their skin like cracks, either showing glimmering gemlike veins or a dim, yellowish glow. Earth genasi hair can appear carved of stone or crystal or resemble strands of spun metal.

## Water Genasi
*Source: [[Mordenkainen's Monsters of the Multiverse]]*
Water genasi descend from marids, aquatic genies from the Elemental Plane of Water. Water genasi are perfectly suited to life underwater and carry the power of the waves inside themselves.
### Appearance
Their skin is often shades of blue or green, sometimes a blend of the two. If they have a human skin tone, there is a glistening texture that catches the light, like water droplets or nearly invisible fish scales.

## Air Genasi (legacy)
*Source: [[Elemental Evil Player's Companion]]*
As an air genasi, you are descended from the djinn. As changeable as the weather, your moods shift from calm to wild and violent with little warning, but these storms rarely last long.
### Appearance

## Earth Genasi (legacy)
*Source: [[Elemental Evil Player's Companion]]*
As an earth genasi, you are descended from the cruel and greedy dao, though you aren’t necessarily evil. You have inherited some measure of control over earth, reveling in superior strength and solid power. You tend to avoid rash decisions, pausing long enough to consider your options before taking action.
### Appearance
Elemental earth manifests differently from one individual to the next. Some earth genasi always have bits of dust falling from their bodies and mud clinging to their clothes, never getting clean no matter how often they bathe. Others are as shiny and polished as gemstones, with skin tones of deep brown or black, eyes sparkling like agates. Earth genasi can also have smooth metallic flesh, dull iron skin spotted with rust, a pebbled and rough hide, or even a coating of tiny embedded crystals. The most arresting have fissures in their flesh, from which faint light shines.

***
## Fire Genasi (legacy)
*Source: [[Elemental Evil Player's Companion]]*
As a fire genasi, you have inherited the volatile mood and keen mind of the efreet. You tend toward impatience and making snap judgments. Rather than hide your distinctive appearance, you exult in it.
### Appearance
Nearly all fire genasi are feverishly hot as if burning inside, an impression reinforced by flaming red, coal- black, or ash-gray skin tones. The more human-looking have fiery red hair that writhes under extreme emotion, while more exotic specimens sport actual flames dancing on their heads. Fire genasi voices might sound like crackling flames, and their eyes flare when angered. Some are accompanied by the faint scent of brimstone.
### Ability Score Increase
Your Intelligence score increases by 1.
### Darkvision
You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light and in darkness as if it were dim light. You discern colors in that darkness only as shades of gray.

***
## Water Genasi (legacy)
*Source: [[Elemental Evil Player's Companion]]*
The lapping of waves, the spray of sea foam on the wind, the ocean depths — all of these things call to your heart. You wander freely and take pride in your independence, though others might consider you selfish.
### Appearance
Most water genasi look as if they just finished bathing, with beads of moisture collecting on their skin and hair. They smell of fresh rain and clean water. Blue or green skin is common, and most have somewhat overlarge eyes, blue-black in color. A water genasi’s hair might float freely, swaying and waving as if underwater. Some have voices with undertones reminiscent of whale song or trickling streams.

You have a swimming speed of 30 feet.

You have resistance to acid damage.
