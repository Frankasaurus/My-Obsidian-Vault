***Walking in two worlds but truly belonging to neither, half-elves combine what some say are the best qualities of their elf and human parents: human curiosity, inventiveness, and ambition tempered by the refined senses, love of nature, and artistic tastes of the elves. Some half-elves live among humans, set apart by their emotional and physical differences, watching friends and loved ones age while time barely touches them. Others live with the elves, growing restless as they reach adulthood in the timeless elven realms, while their peers continue to live as children. Many half-elves, unable to fit into either society, choose lives of solitary wandering or join with other misfits and outcasts in the adventuring life.***

### Ability Score Increase
Your Charisma score increases by 2, and two other ability scores of your choice increase by 1.
### Age
Half-elves mature at the same rate humans do and reach adulthood around the age of 20. They live much longer than humans, however, often exceeding 180 years.
### Size
Half-elves are about the same size as humans, ranging from 5 to 6 feet tall. Your size is Medium.
### Speed
Your base walking speed is 30 feet.

### Fey Ancestry
You have advantage on saving throws against being charmed, and magic can’t put you to sleep.
### Skill Versatility
You gain proficiency in two skills of your choice.
### Languages
You can speak, read, and write Common, Elvish, and one extra language of your choice.

### Aquatic Heritage
A half-elf of aquatic heritage can forgo Skill Versatility and instead choose a swimming speed of 30 feet.

### Drow Magic
A half-elf of drow descent can forgo Skill Versatility and instead choose the drow’s Drow Magic:

You know the [[Dancing Lights]] cantrip. When you reach 3rd level, you can cast the [[Faerie Fire]] spell once with this trait and regain the ability to do so when you finish a long rest. When you reach 5th level, you can cast the [[Darkness]] spell once with this trait and regain the ability to do so when you finish a long rest. Charisma is your spellcasting ability for these spells.
