***Satyrs have a well-earned reputation for their good spirits, gregarious personalities, and love of revels. Most satyrs are driven by simple desires, to see the world and to sample its every pleasure. While their spontaneity and whimsy sometimes put them at odds with more stoic peoples, satyrs rarely let the moodiness of others hinder their own happiness. Life is a blessing from the gods, after all, and the proper response to such a gift, as far as most satyrs are concerned, is to accept it with relish.***

# Satyr Traits
*Source: [[Mordenkainen's Monsters of the Multiverse]]*
### Creature Type
You are a Fey.
### Size
You are Medium.
### Speed
Your walking speed is 35 feet.
### Ram
You can use your head and horns to make unarmed strikes. When you hit with them, the strike deals 1d6 + your Strength modifier bludgeoning damage, instead of the bludgeoning damage normal for an unarmed strike.
### Magic Resistance
You have advantage on saving throws against spells.
### Mirthful Leaps
Whenever you make a long jump or a high jump, you can roll a d8 and add the number rolled to the number of feet you cover, even when making a standing jump. This extra distance costs movement as normal.
### Reveler
As an embodiment of revelry, you have proficiency in the Performance and Persuasion skills, and you have proficiency with one musical instrument of your choice.
### Languages
Your character can speak, read, and write Common and one other language that you and your DM agree is appropriate for the character. The [[Player's Handbook]] offers a list of languages to choose from. The DM is free to modify that list for a campaign.
*Standard languages are Common and Sylvan.*
