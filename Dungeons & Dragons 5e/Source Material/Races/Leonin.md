***Other peoples often perceive leonin as quick to take offense, intolerant of criticism, or belligerent. The truth is that many leonin simply enjoy fighting, whether verbal or physical. They take pleasure in argument, wrestling, sparring, and even battle, enjoying the opportunity to exercise their minds and bodies. It follows, too, that leonin aren’t inclined to carry grudges. A warrior might react with sudden violence to an insult, but when the fight is over (and the leonin’s superiority proven), the insult is forgotten—along with the vanquished foe.***
