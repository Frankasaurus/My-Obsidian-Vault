***Kingdoms rich in ancient grandeur, halls carved into the roots of mountains, the echoing of picks and hammers in deep mines and blazing forges, a commitment to clan and tradition, and a burning hatred of goblins and orcs—these common threads unite all dwarves.***
# Dwarf Traits
*Source: [[Player's Handbook]]*
### Ability Score Increase
Your Constitution score increases by 2.
### Age
Dwarves mature at the same rate as humans, but they’re considered young until they reach the age of 50. On average, they live about 350 years.
### Size
Dwarves stand between 4 and 5 feet tall and average about 150 pounds. Your size is Medium.
### Speed
Your base walking speed is 25 feet. Your speed is not reduced by wearing heavy armor.
### Darkvision
Accustomed to life underground, you have superior vision in dark and dim conditions. You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You can’t discern color in darkness, only shades of gray.
### Dwarven Resilience
You have advantage on saving throws against poison, and you have resistance against poison damage (explained in the “Combat” section).
### Dwarven Combat Training
You have proficiency with the battleaxe, handaxe, light hammer, and warhammer.
### Tool Proficiency
You gain proficiency with the artisan’s tools of your choice: smith’s tools, brewer’s supplies, or mason’s tools.
### Stonecunning
Whenever you make an Intelligence (History) check related to the origin of stonework, you are considered proficient in the History skill and add double your proficiency bonus to the check, instead of your normal proficiency bonus.
### Languages
You can speak, read, and write Common and Dwarvish. Dwarvish is full of hard consonants and guttural sounds, and those characteristics spill over into whatever other language a dwarf might speak.
## Hill Dwarf
*Source: [[Player's Handbook]]*
As a hill dwarf, you have keen senses, deep intuition, and remarkable resilience. The gold dwarves of Faerûn in their mighty southern kingdom are hill dwarves, as are the exiled Neidar and the debased Klar of Krynn in the Dragonlance setting.
### Ability Score Increase
Your Wisdom score increases by 1.
### Dwarven Toughness
Your hit point maximum increases by 1, and it increases by 1 every time you gain a level.
## Mountain Dwarf
*Source: [[Player's Handbook]]*
As a mountain dwarf, you’re strong and hardy, accustomed to a difficult life in rugged terrain. You’re probably on the tall side (for a dwarf), and tend toward lighter coloration. The shield dwarves of northern Faerûn, as well as the ruling Hylar clan and the noble Daewar clan of Dragonlance, are mountain dwarves.
### Ability Score Increase
Your Strength score increases by 2.
### Dwarven Armor Training
You have proficiency with light and medium armor.
## Gray Dwarf (legacy)
*Source: [[Sword Coast Adventurer's Guide]]*
The gray dwarves, or duergar, live deep in the Underdark. After delving deeper than any other dwarves, they were enslaved by mind flayers for eons. Although they eventually won their freedom, these grim, ashen-skinned dwarves now take slaves of their own and are as tyrannical as their former masters.
### Ability Score Increase
Your Strength score increases by 1.
### Superior Darkvision
Your darkvision has a radius of 120 feet.
### Extra Language
You can speak, read, and write Undercommon.
### Duergar Resilience
You have advantage on saving throws against illusions and against being charmed or paralyzed.
### Duergar Magic
When you reach 3rd level, you can cast the [[Enlarge/Reduce]] spell on yourself once with this trait, using only the spell’s enlarge option. When you reach 5th level, you can cast the [[Invisibility]] spell on yourself once with this trait. You don’t need material components for either spell, and you can’t cast them while you’re in direct sunlight, although sunlight has no effect on them once cast. You regain the ability to cast these spells with this trait when you finish a long rest. Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for these spells.
### Sunlight Sensitivity
You have disadvantage on attack rolls and on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on sight when you, the target of your attack, or whatever you are trying to perceive is in direct sunlight.
