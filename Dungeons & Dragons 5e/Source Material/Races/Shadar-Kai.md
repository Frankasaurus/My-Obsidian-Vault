***Shadar-kai are the elves of the Shadowfell, originally drawn to that dread realm by the Raven Queen. Over the centuries, some of them have continued to serve her, while others have ventured into the Material Plane to forge their own destinies. Once shadar-kai were Fey like the rest of their elven kin; now they exist in a state between life and death, thanks to being transformed by the Shadowfell’s grim energy. Shadar-kai have ashen skin tones, and while they’re in the Shadowfell, they also become wizened, reflecting the somber nature of that gloomy plane.***

# Shadar-Kai Traits
*Source: [[Mordenkainen's Monsters of the Multiverse]]*
### Ability Score Increase
When determining your character’s ability scores, increase one score by 2 and increase a different score by 1, or increase three different scores by 1. You can't raise any of your scores above 20.
*Standard scores are Dexterity +2, and Constitution +1.*
### Creature Type
You are a Humanoid. You are also considered an elf for any prerequisite or effect that requires you to be an elf.
### Size
You are Medium.
### Speed
Your walking speed is 30 feet, and you have a swimming speed equal to your walking speed.
### Necrotic Resistance
You have resistance to necrotic damage.
### Darkvision
You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light and in darkness as if it were dim light. You discern colors in that darkness only as shades of gray.
### Fey Ancestry
You have advantage on saving throws you make to avoid or end the charmed condition on yourself.
### Blessing of the Raven Queen
As a bonus action, you can magically teleport up to 30 feet to an unoccupied space you can see. You can use this trait a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest. Starting at 3rd level, you also gain resistance to all damage when you teleport using this trait. The resistance lasts until the start of your next turn. During that time, you appear ghostly and translucent.
### Keen Senses
You have proficiency in the Perception skill.
### Trance
You don’t need to sleep, and magic can’t put you to sleep. You can finish a long rest in 4 hours if you spend those hours in a trancelike meditation, during which you retain consciousness.
- Whenever you finish this trance, you can change your season, and you can gain two proficiencies that you don’t have, each one with a weapon or a tool of your choice selected from the [[Player's Handbook]]. You mystically acquire these proficiencies by drawing them from shared elven memory, and you retain them until you finish your next long rest.
### Languages
Your character can speak, read, and write Common and one other language that you and your DM agree is appropriate for the character. The [[Player's Handbook]] offers a list of languages to choose from. The DM is free to modify that list for a campaign.
*Standard languages are Common, and Elven.*
