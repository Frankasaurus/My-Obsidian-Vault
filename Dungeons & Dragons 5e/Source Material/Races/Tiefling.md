***To be greeted with stares and whispers, to suffer violence and insult on the street, to see mistrust and fear in every eye: this is the lot of the tiefling. And to twist the knife, tieflings know that this is because a pact struck generations ago infused the essence of Asmodeus—overlord of the Nine Hells—into their bloodline. Their appearance and their nature are not their fault but the result of an ancient sin, for which they and their children and their children’s children will always be held accountable.***
# Tiefling Traits
*Source: [[Player's Handbook]]*
### Ability Score Increase
Your Intelligence score increases by 1, and your Charisma score increases by 2.
### Age
Tieflings mature at the same rate as humans but live a few years longer.
### Size
Tieflings are about the same size and build as humans. Your size is Medium.
### Speed
Your base walking speed is 30 feet.
### Darkvision
Thanks to your infernal heritage, you have superior vision in dark and dim conditions. You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You can’t discern color in darkness, only shades of gray.
### Hellish Resistance
You have resistance to fire damage.
### Infernal Legacy
You know the [[Thaumaturgy]] cantrip. When you reach 3rd level, you can cast the [[Hellish Rebuke]] spell as a 2nd-level spell once with this trait and regain the ability to do so when you finish a long rest. When you reach 5th level, you can cast the [[Darkness]] spell once with this trait and regain the ability to do so when you finish a long rest. Charisma is your spellcasting ability for these spells.
### Languages
You can speak, read, and write Common and Infernal.
## Variant Feral Tiefling
*Source: [[Sword Coast Adventurer's Guide]]*
Since not all tieflings are of the blood of Asmodeus, some have traits that differ from those in the [[Player's Handbook]]. The Dungeon Master may permit the following variants for your tiefling character, although Devil’s Tongue, Hellfire, and Winged are mutually exclusive.
### Feral
Your Intelligence score increases by 1, and your Dexterity score increases by 2. This trait replaces the Ability Score Increase trait.
### Appearance
Your tiefling might not look like other tieflings. Rather than having the physical characteristics described in the _Player's Handbook_, choose 1d4 + 1 of the following features: small horns; fangs or sharp teeth; a forked tongue; catlike eyes; six fingers on each hand; goat-like legs; cloven hoofs; a forked tail; leathery or scaly skin; red or dark blue skin; cast no shadow or reflection; exude a smell of brimstone.
### Devil’s Tongue
You know the [[Vicious Mockery]] cantrip. When you reach 3rd level, you can cast the [[Charm Person]] spell as a 2nd-level spell once with this trait. When you reach 5th level, you can cast the [[Enthrall]] spell once with this trait. You must finish a long rest to cast these spells once again with this trait. Charisma is your spellcasting ability for them. This trait replaces the Infernal Legacy trait.
### Hellfire
Once you reach 3rd level, you can cast the [[Burning Hands]] spell once per day as a 2nd-level spell. This trait replaces the [[Hellish Rebuke]] spell of the Infernal Legacy trait.
### Winged
Bat-like wings jut from your shoulder blades. You have a flying speed of 30 feet while you aren’t wearing heavy armor.
