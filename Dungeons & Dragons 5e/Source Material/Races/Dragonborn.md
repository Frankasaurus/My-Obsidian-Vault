***Born of dragons, as their name proclaims, the dragonborn walk proudly through a world that greets them with fearful incomprehension. Shaped by draconic gods or the dragons themselves, dragonborn originally hatched from dragon eggs as a unique race, combining the best attributes of dragons and humanoids. Some dragonborn are faithful servants to true dragons, others form the ranks of soldiers in great wars, and still others find themselves adrift, with no clear calling in life.***

# Dragonborn Traits
*Source: [[Player's Handbook]]*
### Ability Score Increase
Your Strength score increases by 2, and your Charisma score increases by 1.
### Age
Young dragonborn grow quickly. They walk hours after hatching, attain the size and development of a 10-year-old human child by the age of 3, and reach adulthood by 15. They live to be around 80.
### Size
Dragonborn are taller and heavier than humans, standing well over 6 feet tall and averaging almost 250 pounds. Your size is Medium.
### Speed
Your base walking speed is 30ft.
### Languages
You can speak, read, and write Common and Draconic. Draconic is thought to be one of the oldest languages and is often used in the study of magic. The language sounds harsh to most other creatures and includes numerous hard consonants and sibilants.
### Draconic Ancestry
You have draconic ancestry. Choose one type of dragon from the Draconic Ancestry table. Your breath weapon and damage resistance are determined by the dragon type, as shown in the table.

**Draconic Ancestry**

| Dragon | Damage Type | Breath Weapon                |
| ------ | ----------- | ---------------------------- |
| **Black**  | Acid        | 5 by 30 ft. line (Dex. save) |
| **Blue**   | Lightning   | 5 by 30 ft. line (Dex. save) |
| **Brass**  | Fire        | 5 by 30 ft. line (Dex. save) |
| **Bronze** | Lightning   | 5 by 30 ft. line (Dex. save) |
| **Copper** | Acid        | 5 by 30 ft. line (Dex. save) |

| **White**  | Cold        | 15 ft. cone (Dex. save)      | 
### Breath Weapon
You can use your action to exhale destructive energy. Your draconic ancestry determines the size, shape, and damage type of the exhalation. When you use your breath weapon, each creature in the area of the exhalation must make a saving throw, the type of which is determined by your draconic ancestry. The DC for this saving throw equals 8 + your Constitution modifier + your proficiency bonus. A creature takes 2d6 damage on a failed save, and half as much damage on a successful one. The damage increases to 3d6 at 6th level, 4d6 at 11th level, and 5d6 at 16th level. After you use your breath weapon, you can’t use it again until you complete a short or long rest.
### Damage Resistance
You have resistance to the damage type associated with your draconic ancestry.

> **The Subraces below are optional, and the [[#Draconblood Dragonborn]] and [[#Ravenite Dragonborn]] subclasses er not standard.** 
> *The Draconic Ancestry, Breath Weapon, and Damage Resistance traits are replaced when building a Dragonborn using any of the subraces.*

## Chromatic Ancestry
*Source: [[Fizban's Treasury of Dragons]]*
Dragonborn with chromatic ancestry claim the raw elemental power of chromatic dragons. The vibrant colors of black, blue, green, red, and white dragons gleam in those dragonborn’s scaled skin and in the deadly energy of their breath weapons. Theirs is the raw elemental fury of the volcano, of biting arctic winds, and of raging lightning storms, as well as the subtle whisper of swamp and forest, toxic and corrosive.
### Chromatic Ancestry
You have a chromatic dragon ancestor, granting you a special magical affinity. Choose one kind of dragon from the Chromatic Ancestry table. This determines the damage type for your other traits, as shown in the table.

**Chromatic Ancestry**

|Dragon|Damage Type|
|---|---|
|Black|Acid|
|Blue|Lightning|
|Green|Poison|
|Red|Fire|
|White|Cold|
### Breath Weapon
When you take the Attack action on your turn, you can replace one of your attacks with an exhalation of magical energy in a 30-foot line that is 5 feet wide. Each creature in that area must make a Dexterity saving throw (DC = 8 + your Constitution modifier + your proficiency bonus). On a failed save, the creature takes 1d10 damage of the type associated with your Chromatic Ancestry. On a successful save, it takes half as much damage. This damage increases by 1d10 when you reach 5th level (2d10), 11th level (3d10), and 17th level (4d10).

You can use your Breath Weapon a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.
### Draconic Resistance
You have resistance to the damage type associated with your Chromatic Ancestry.
### Chromatic Warding
Starting at 5th level, as an action, you can channel your draconic energy to protect yourself. For 1 minute, you become immune to the damage type associated with your Chromatic Ancestry. Once you use this trait, you can’t do so again until you finish a long rest.

Gem dragonborn partake of the heritage of gem dragons, who claim to be heirs of Sardior, the Ruby Dragon. The colors and mysterious powers of gem dragons - amethyst, crystal, emerald, sapphire, and topaz - gleam in these dragonborn’s scaled skin and course through their veins. Theirs are the wonders of the mind, the force of will, the brilliant light of insight, and the resounding echo of discovery - but also the desiccation of despair.

**Gem Ancestry**

|Dragon|Damage Type|

This damage increases by 1d10 when you reach 5th level (2d10), 11th level (3d10), and 17th level (4d10).

### Gem Flight
Starting at 5th level, you can use a bonus action to manifest spectral wings on your body. These wings last for 1 minute. For the duration, you gain a flying speed equal to your walking speed and can hover. Once you use this trait, you can’t do so again until you finish a long rest.

Dragonborn with metallic ancestry lay claim to the tenacity of metallic dragons - brass, bronze, copper, gold, and silver - whose hues glint in their scales.
