***The story of the gith is rooted in a cruel twist of cosmic fate. Inspired by the great leader for whom the race is named, the gith rose up to overthrow the mind flayers that held them in servitude. But after they won their freedom, two factions among the gith disagreed on what kind of civilization they would forge. That disagreement quickly flared into open hostility, and the two groups distanced themselves from one another to pursue their separate agendas. They remain bitter enemies today, each side willing to fight to the death whenever they cross paths.***

> *These variants are nearly identical, save for some of the wording.*

## Githyanki
*Source: [[Mordenkainen's Monsters of the Multiverse]]*
Once members of a people who escaped servitude to mind flayers, githyanki split from their cousins, githzerai, and fled to the Astral Plane. In that timeless, silvery realm, githyanki honed their psionic powers and built a great city called Tu’narath. They have since spread throughout the multiverse, starting in outposts outside the Astral Plane, called creches, where time passes and their children can reach adulthood.
### Astral Knowledge
You can mystically access a reservoir of experiences of entities connected to the Astral Plane. Whenever you finish a long rest, you gain proficiency in one skill of your choice and with one weapon or tool of your choice, selected from the [[Player's Handbook]], as you momentarily project your consciousness into the Astral Plane. These proficiencies last until the end of your next long rest.
### Githyanki Psionics
You know the [[Mage Hand]] cantrip, and the hand is invisible when you cast the cantrip with this trait. Starting at 3rd level, you can cast the [[Jump]] spell with this trait. Starting at 5th level, you can also cast the [[Misty Step]] spell with it. Once you cast jump or misty step with this trait, you can’t cast that spell with it again until you finish a long rest. You can also cast either of those spells using any spell slots you have of the appropriate level.
- Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma is your spellcasting ability for these spells when you cast them with this trait (choose when you select this race). None of these spells require spell components when you cast them with this trait.
### Psychic Resilience
You have resistance to psychic damage.

## Githzerai
*Source: [[Mordenkainen's Monsters of the Multiverse]]*
Githzerai migrated to the Everchanging Chaos of Limbo after the ancient schism that split their ancestors from their cousins, githyanki. Limbo is a roiling maelstrom of matter and energy, collapsing and reforming without purpose or direction, until a creature exerts deliberate will to stabilize it. Through their potent psionic power, githzerai carved a home for themselves amid the chaos. As the ages passed, githzerai explorers ranged out to other planes and worlds of the multiverse.
### Githzerai Psionics
You know the [[Mage Hand]] cantrip, and the hand is invisible when you cast the cantrip with this trait. Starting at 3rd level, you can cast the [[Shield]] spell with this trait. Starting at 5th level, you can also cast the [[Detect Thoughts]] spell with it. Once you cast shield or detect thoughts with this trait, you can’t cast that spell with it again until you finish a long rest. You can also cast either of those spells using any spell slots you have of the appropriate level.
- Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma is your spellcasting ability for these spells when you cast them with this trait (choose when you select this race). None of these spells require spell components when you cast them with this trait.
### Mental Discipline
Your innate psychic defenses grant you advantage on saving throws you make to avoid or end the charmed and frightened conditions on yourself.

## Githyanki (legacy)
*Source: [[Mordenkainen's Tome of Foes]]*
The githyanki were motivated by revenge and convinced that they deserved to take whatever they wanted from the worlds they traveled. Ranging out from the titanic city of Tu’narath on the Astral Plane, they send raiders out to plunder the Material Plane and other worlds, bringing treasures and slaves back to their ageless realm. At the same time, they hunt down and kill mind flayers whenever possible, as recompense for what the illithids did to them.

## Githzerai (legacy)
*Source: [[Mordenkainen's Tome of Foes]]*
The githzerai believed that the path to an enlightened civilization lay in seclusion, not conflict. Their dedication to the principles of order is so strong that they can manipulate the stuff of chaos and use it to their benefit; thus, they have carved out a stronghold for themselves on the plane of Limbo that is virtually impervious. Though the githzerai are pacifists by nature, they share the githyanki’s racial hatred for mind flayers, and from time to time they send out squads to destroy illithid outposts.
### Ability Score Increase
Your Wisdom score increases by 2.
### Mental Discipline
You have advantage on saving throws against the charmed and frightened conditions. Under the tutelage of monastic masters, githzerai learn to govern their own minds.

When you reach 5th level, you can cast the [[Detect Thoughts]] spell once with this trait, and you regain the ability to do so when you finish a long rest.
