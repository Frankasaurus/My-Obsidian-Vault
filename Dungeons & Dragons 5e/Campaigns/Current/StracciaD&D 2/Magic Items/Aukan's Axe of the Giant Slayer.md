# Description
You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon.  
  
When you hit a giant with it, the giant takes an extra 2d6 damage of the weapon's type and must succeed on a DC 15 Strength saving throw or fall prone. For the purpose of this weapon, "giant" refers to any creature with the giant type, including ettins and trolls.  
  
Proficiency with a battleaxe allows you to add your proficiency bonus to the attack roll for any attack you make with it.
