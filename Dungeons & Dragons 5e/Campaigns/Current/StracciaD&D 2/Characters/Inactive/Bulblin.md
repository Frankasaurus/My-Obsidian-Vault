## Before the campaign
Far in the eastern regions resides a people that few individuals dare to venture towards. Deep within the dark forests of the Bloeming Isles, these monstrous creations have hidden themselves. Each one has their own role, based on their family. Deviation from this was unheard of, and thus, family name clearly indicated the job and/or task one carried out.

We are talking about goblins. Green, small but strong and fierce beings with a mind of their own. Bulblin is a goblin from the Wormbone family. For centuries, weapons and armor had been forged and supplied by this family. In a small dugout hollow beneath a large ancient tree, the glow of the smelting furnace could still be seen at night, where Bulblin diligently worked to forge the high demand. Bulblin is a hard worker, leading a tough but, compared to others, good life. Many goblins have their own stories and roles in this manner. This tradition had continued for centuries.

Despite centuries of not being attacked, goblins are always prepared. Bulblin was in his goblin hole, hard at work as always in the middle of the night, when a loud crash struck the entrance of his den. Mud, branches, and bits of bark torn from trees blasted into Bulblin's hollow. The emergency horn, ready for centuries to be used in case of an attack, was blown. It was serious. Bulblin picked himself up, still recovering from the impact. He quickly rushed to the back to grab his shortsword and shortbow with accompanying arrows. Self-forged, he looked proudly at his shortsword. The only one of its kind, resembling a scimitar but forged with utmost precision only a goblin could achieve. With a shield on his back and a chained shirt on, Bulblin sprinted outside. Everything was in shambles, and the bright light from the burning trees limited visibility to a mere 5 to 10 meters. Attackers still unknown.

Soon, Bulblin managed to find comrades, and together they headed to the city gate to defend it. Emerging from the glaring light were large shadows, larger than any he had seen before. A deep growl followed, revealing that a large group of Bugbears was charging towards them. Fighting valiantly, the brave goblins were no match for the much stronger Bugbears. Hours of struggle ensued, with Bulblin losing more and more comrades. Driven back by the Bugbears, Bulblin found himself far from the city, deep within the forest. He managed to escape the Bugbears and fled.

Weeks passed. Bulblin was well-acquainted with the deep woods and managed to hold his ground. Alongside his wild boar, with which he had become close friends, he carved a path to the west, searching for other survivors. He found none. He did stumble upon a coastline with traders. They eyed the goblin riding on a wild boar as it came charging towards them with apprehension. This kind had never been encountered here before. Bulblin, not knowing any better, accepted an offer to work for a weapons and armor merchant. Unaware of what lay ahead, Bulblin stepped onto a ship heading west.
