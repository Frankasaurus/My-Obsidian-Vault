# Description
## Appearance
Elisabeth is a young adult bronze-skinned [[Tiefling]]. Like other members of the [[Dragoness family]], parts of her skin is covered with segments of dark orange scales. She's of slender build, and has green lizard-like eyes. Two horns protrude from her forehead, wrapping backwards over her head.
Elisabeth is dressed in modest noble clothing, including a large cloak designed to somewhat obscure both her heritage and wealth. (KIM WAT NOG MEER?)
## Personality
Her noble personality makes Elisabeth excel in difficult to navigate social encounters, often shutting down arguments with ruthless passive aggressiveness. She is not opposed to using her heritage in arguments, and often puts pride before gains. 
# Biography
## Before the campaign
Born in the newly thriving Dragoness Barony as the youngest of 5 siblings, Elisabeth was the pride and joy of her parents. Despite her brothers getting ample opportunity to venture the world, Elisabeth was forced to remain isolated on the palace grounds, never seeing the rest of the city or the surrounding area from nearby for her whole life. Here, she grew up amongst the hostilities of nobility, but also grew very close to her four brothers. Each of the siblings chose something to specialize in whilst growing up at the palace, with Elizabeth studying magic. The natural skill of Elisabeth proved to be far greater than anyone else in their bloodline.

When Elisabeth was 23, her life was turned on its head, when in a sudden fit of panic her father notified her of a terrible secret that had been stolen from the family - A secret so dire that could ruin more than just the name of the Dragonesses were it ever to become public knowledge. Without being able to ask questions, she was to be put on a royal charter straight to the Bloeming Isle's [[Telack]], to meet with [[Wilmide Ostver]]. She was told he owes their family a favor, for which in return, Wilmide could help Elisabeth trace this secret, and eliminate anyone or anything that could risk it becoming public knowledge. All the while Elisabeth was never told about anything she was supposed to be looking for.
