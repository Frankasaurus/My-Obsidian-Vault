# Description
## Appearance
Vimak a large and muscular [[Goliath]] with blueish grey skin, tattoo's that cover his body, and a deep vertical scar over his eye. He is slightly bearded and otherwise bald, though Goliath Kin aren't known to have extensive facial hair. 

Vimak is dressed in quite a bit of armour, though he keeps it relatively minimal, preferring to prance in a long coat from his homeland at all times. His time at sea has given him sturdy sea legs and boots to fit them. His two axes are hung from his waist, one at each side.
When at sea, or when acting as Captain of [[The Bonehead]], Vimak wears a large wide-brimmed captain's hat, bought in [[Meqen]].
## Personality
Vimak is a loud and outspoken personality, often teaming up with [[Roderick]] when interrogating or questioning someone or something. He's not afraid to get his hands dirty, and involves himself with as much of the party's hard work as he can.
# Biography
## Before the campaign
Vimak "Lonehunter" Vaimei-Laga is a goliath from the [[Devostina Alps]]. He is the firstborn son of his father [[Kuori "Bearkiller"]] Vaimei-Laga and his mother [[Lo-Kag "Wordpainter"]] Vaimei-Laga. Both his mother and father were known as skilled warriors and respected members of their clan, the [[Gathakeaku Clan]].

When Vimak was 3 years old, he got a brother named [[Aukan "Keepeye"]] Vaimei-Laga. Aukan and Vimak grew up together and seemed to have a strong bond, but over the years, this bond soured as the brothers didn't want to be outdone by each other. Who was the better hunter? Who was the superior warrior? And so on. All of this was to gain the respect of their parents, and both had aspirations of becoming the leader of their clan. As they grew older, it became clearer that Aukan "seemed to be the better of the two," and Vimak gradually became more jealous of his brother's talent.

One day, the brothers were hunting together and they got into a conflict. As is the nature of goliaths, this conflict was literally "fought out." In a moment of blind rage, Vimak did the unthinkable. He grabbed his axe, and before he even realized what he had done, he saw the still trembling body of Aukan lying there, an axe through his eye.

In a state of panic and confusion, Vimak ran back to the camp of his clan. There, he confessed his deed to his parents. His parents were furious, shocked, and saddened. Vimak, uncertain of his fate, took his parents to the spot where the incident had occurred, where they found the lifeless body of Aukan.

In his clan, there was only one punishment for killing a family member: death. However, when the entire incident was presented to the clan leader [[Nalla "Fearless" Ogolakanu]], she decided not to execute Vimak. Instead, he chose to banish Vimak, although she wanted Vimak to have a lasting reminder of killing his brother. Nalla told Kuori that he had to drive a knife through Vimak's eye. This left him with a scar that is visible to this day. When Vimak was sent away, he received one last gift from his mother: an axe, [[Aukan's Axe of the Giant Slayer|his brother's axe]].

In his exile, Vimak saught to travel the world, and restore his own pride and legacy, turning to [[Hevenar]] for guidance. The God is said to preach the two deaths; the first when you breathe your last breath, the second when your name is spoken for the last time. This suited Vimak's goals, and in his name he ventured forth, until finally reaching [[Telack]], where he met a group op new friends.

## Quests
Vimak is trying to find his place in the world, partially achieved by traveling around to see what is out there beyond the Alps he grew up in. More importantly, is to find inner peace and redemption for what happened with Aukan, which is the main reason why he became a [[Paladin]].

> Something came up along the way. His tribe is in need of help. In his absence, Giant Kin have awoken from their centuries long slumber, to once again clean the land of the smaller and weaker race, in order to manifest more giants, which puts the [[Gathakeaku Clan]] at risk.
