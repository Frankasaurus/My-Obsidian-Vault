# Biography
Along with her husband [[Jules Charr Sr.]], she participated in the establishing of the [[Dragoness Barony]] walls. Though not a member, she was sympathetic to the cause of the [[Dragoness Barony#Dragoness Freedom Legion|Dragoness Freedom Legion]], and for her ties to it, as well as her connection with Jules, she was persecuted to life imprisonment, but not before sending her kids towards boats from the [[Bloeming Isles]] in order for them to flee.

She was released shortly after her husband's death, and destined to roam the streets in grief, which has been her life for the past couple of decades, not being able to snap out of her spiral.
