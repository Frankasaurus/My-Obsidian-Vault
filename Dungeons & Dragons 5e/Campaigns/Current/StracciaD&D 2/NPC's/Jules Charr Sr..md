# Biography

Jules Charr was a strong farmer's son, who was one of the people involved with building the city walls of [[Dragoness Barony]], and threw a big stink when they didn't get paid. Though they were housed within the city (unlinke others), Jules and several others joined the emerging [[Dragoness Barony#Dragoness Freedom Legion|Dragoness Freedom Legion]].

For his actions, he eventualy was prosecuted and sentenced to the dungeons, but not before sending his wife and two children off towards the trading ships from the [[Bloeming Isles]]. He died in captivity, and became a martyr to the cause. Nearly 30 years later, he is still remembered as the founding member and main face of the resistance.
