# Description
## Appearance
Currently, Doreen is a befudled individual, who often goes days without washing or changing clothes. Her long fiery red hair has dulled and is messily tied in a braid, and her red skin is sunken in somewhat due to malnurishment. Though she has bags under her eyes from many restless nights, she maintains a steady look. Most notably, in contrast with her son [[Carmine Char|Carmine]], the color in her eyes have faded to smouldering clumps of coal, rather than a glowing ember.
## Personality
Doreen is very aware of her predicament, but also too tired and helpless to do anything about it. She does not wallow in the streets looking for handouts, but uses whatever energy she can to find sustanance herself in fish and algae, helped by her survival skills from roaming the wilds after departing from the Elemental planes of Fire. She is sympathetic, wholistic, and quick to trust.
# Biography
Along with her husband [[Jules Char Sr.]], she participated in the establishing of the [[Dragoness Barony]] walls, shortly after departing the Elemental Planes. Though not a member, she was sympathetic to the cause of the [[Dragoness Barony#Dragoness Freedom Legion|Dragoness Freedom Legion]] after living there for several years. Her ties to it, as well as her connection with Jules, she was persecuted to life imprisonment, but not before sending her kids towards boats from the [[Bloeming Isles]] in order for them to flee.

She was released shortly after her husband's death, and destined to roam the streets in grief, which has been her life for the past couple of decades, not being able to snap out of her spiral.
# Relationships
### Cirdorim
Due to frequent visits whenever she is at her lowest, she is loosely acquainted with [[Cirdorim]] in human form, as her healer. The quick-to-trust nature and shared wisdom of both Cirdorim and Doreen has led to memorable enough conversations as to have them know each other's names.
