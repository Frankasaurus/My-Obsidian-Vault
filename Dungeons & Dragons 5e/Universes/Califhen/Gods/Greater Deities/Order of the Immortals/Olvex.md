# Description
> Todo: Description of what they're associated with, whom typically worship them, and perhaps the most important fact.
## Appearance
Olvex in humanoid form is often depicted as a short, greying, elderly elven man, wearing Immortal order robes. Perfect circles are also associated with Olvex in some instances, especially in abstract art.
# Worship
Creation in a broad sense is all Olvex expects; to make something exist which did not exist before. Regular prayer is often linked with brainstorming, allowing Olvex to inspire you.
Not childbirth specifically, but the building of a family is what Olvex desires most of all. Closely allied with [[Enezor]], this building of community is an abstract art of Creation.
Material Artistry and invention - creating something from nothing - is often associated with Olvex, as well as [[Saaber]]. Some of the best artists are known to have worshipped Olvex, with their masterpiece often a combination of all known forms of Creation as a form of worship. It is important to stress that more is not strictly better.
