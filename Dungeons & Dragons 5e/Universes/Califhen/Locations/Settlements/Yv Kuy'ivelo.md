Yv Ak’io’s burial site is not known, but Yv Kuy’ivelo used to be his resting place during his final decades. His home has become a shrine and sanctuary to those that seek his guidance, and it’s essentially where the hero of Yv Ak’io finds his home. Due to its prominence, however, it has gained a lot of attraction from settlers looking for a place down south, and it is in part due to the expansion of Yv Kuy’ivelo that made the small settlement a true village.
