# Description
Dragoness Barony is a small city on the east coast of [[Greyskil]], located between [[Gabong]] and [[Yyh'ma]]. Though the Dragoness lands are thought to be very old, they were little more than farmfields up until several decenia ago, when [[Xavion de Dragoness]] de Dragoness - [[Dragoness family]]'s elder - made a secret pact with a Blue Dragon, [[Kruziik'ahraan]]. Though not publicly known, this resulted in the exchange of extremely valueable materials with which to build and establish a Barony, and all Dragoness' future children.
It trades with its neighboring coastal cities mostly through ships, but has shut its gates to Gabong's refugees for several years, resulting in a stalemate of trade. Bad management and favoritism of wealth also resulted in lower agricultural yields, and unequal distribution.
## Order Quadrant
More than three quarters of the main city consists of densely-packed streets and businesses, known as the Order Quadrant. Because of the restrictions on movement, many old streets and city squares have since been repurposed into housing. Though not squalid, most of the cities inhabitants live in poverty, with direct trade of goods or services being dominant over using currencies, even when employed by the nobility of the city. Most homes are constructed out of old rocks and repurposed wood, with a liberal use of sheets and old sails, as they provide ventilation. There are little to no city services, save for the [[#Order Guard]].
Its old name of Honorhaven has recently been changed due to the district council being disbanded by the City's army, led by [[Fumyss|General Fumyss]]. Its new name of the Order Quadrant is derived from a speech given by [[Charles de Dragoness]], captain of the Palace Guard, in which he stated that "... with the introduction of General Fumyss Order Guard, this Quadrant of Chaos will once again be restored to a Quadrant of Order.".
## Bronze Reach
The remaining quarter of the city is a liberally laid-out noble's playground, where state-owned ground is assigned to nobility in the area. Its infrastructure is built from materials purchased from far away, and reflects the cities' previous international wealth in trade. Without trade, it is expected of each noble house living in the Reach to establish a company to contribute to the isolated cities survivability. 
There are communal areas here, as the folks who do not actively run businesses mostly act as socialites, though a portion of the noble houses have establish local neighborhood watches as a response to the perceived dangers of laborers from the Order Quadrant. 
## Palace Grounds
A monumental villa with flowing open corridors, the palace grounds house little more than residency for the Dragoness family. No expense spared, it features many wings for each family member, and has been gradually expanding the larger the family got. It's connected to the rest of the city with the Honored Flight, a slope that gradually takes one from the Bronze Reach to the Palace yards, which themselves are as big as the main building. Its size is both as a display of wealth, housing many artifacts and sculptures on display, as well as facilitatie the occassional dragon.
Besides residence for the Dragoness', a guest house is available on the premises, as well as a smaller section of buildings for both staff and distant relatives. Instead of a stable, the Palace Grounds have a tunnel connected to a Drake Yard just outside the perimiter walls.
