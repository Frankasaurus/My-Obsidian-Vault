# Description
Dragoness Barony is a small city on the east coast of [[Greyskil]], located between [[Gabong]] and [[Yyh'ma]]. Though the Dragoness lands are thought to be very old, they were little more than farmfields up until several decenia ago, when [[Xavion de Dragoness]] de Dragoness - [[Dragoness Family]]'s elder - made a secret pact with a Blue Dragon, [[Kruziik'ahraan]]. Though not publicly known, this resulted in the exchange of extremely valueable materials with which to build and establish a Barony, and all Dragoness' future children.
It trades with its neighboring coastal cities mostly through ships, but has shut its gates to Gabong's refugees for several years, resulting in a stalemate of trade. Bad management and favoritism of wealth also resulted in lower agricultural yields, and unequal distribution.
## Order Quadrant
More than three quarters of the main city consists of densely-packed streets and businesses, known as the Order Quadrant. Because of the restrictions on movement, many old streets and city squares have since been repurposed into housing. Though not squalid, most of the cities inhabitants live in poverty, with direct trade of goods or services being dominant over using currencies, even when employed by the nobility of the city. Most homes are constructed out of old rocks and repurposed wood, with a liberal use of sheets and old sails, as they provide ventilation. There are little to no city services, save for the [[#Order Guard]].
Its old name of Honorhaven has recently been changed due to the district council being disbanded by the City's army, led by [[Fumyss|General Fumyss]]. Its new name of the Order Quadrant is derived from a speech given by [[Charles de Dragoness]], captain of the Palace Guard, in which he stated that "... with the introduction of General Fumyss Order Guard, this Quadrant of Chaos will once again be restored to a Quadrant of Order.".
## Bronze Reach
The remaining quarter of the city is a liberally laid-out noble's playground, where state-owned ground is assigned to nobility in the area. Its infrastructure is built from materials purchased from far away, and reflects the cities' previous international wealth in trade. Without trade, it is expected of each noble house living in the Reach to establish a company to contribute to the isolated cities survivability. 
There are communal areas here, as the folks who do not actively run businesses mostly act as socialites, though a portion of the noble houses have establish local neighborhood watches as a response to the perceived dangers of laborers from the Order Quadrant. 
## Palace Grounds
A monumental villa with flowing open corridors, the palace grounds house little more than residency for the Dragoness family. No expense spared, it features many wings for each family member, and has been gradually expanding the larger the family got. It's connected to the rest of the city with the Honored Flight, a slope that gradually takes one from the Bronze Reach to the Palace yards, which themselves are as big as the main building. Its size is both as a display of wealth, housing many artifacts and sculptures on display, as well as facilitatie the occassional dragon.
Besides residence for the Dragoness', a guest house is available on the premises, as well as a smaller section of buildings for both staff and distant relatives. Instead of a stable, the Palace Grounds have a tunnel connected to a Drake Yard just outside the perimiter walls.

# Society
Due to the relative youth of Dragoness Barony, a decisively unique culture has not been established yet. More so, the poverty and oppression of the general public has diminished any remaining drive for feasts of the year. The only real destinctive trait of the people of the order quadrant, is that they are tought the dichotomy of luck at a very young age; that luck is not relative to the moment, but determined at ones birth, and can be offset with hard and honest labor. 

On the other hand, the nobility of the city - while also not destinctly rich in unqiue culture - does enjoy regular feasts; about once every week some type of celebration will take place, often at large gatherings within the Bronze Reach, but certainly often at the Palace Grounds as well. These feasts, balls, gala's, ceremonies and other events form the day-to-day duties of most nobles, though others are more reserved. Individualism and investing are common traits the nobles will have, and nearly all the nobility does not originate from the Dragoness regions.
## Leadership
Free Baron [[Xavion de Dragoness]] is the Feudal Baron of Dragoness Barony. This includes the lands surrounding the walls and the farms dotted around these lands, as well as some of the small villages leading to and from other cities. He has absolute control, though he uses advisors for counceling. The Order Guard and Palace Guard carry out most, if not all commands.

## Defense
### Order Guard
Led by [[Fumyss|General Fumyss]], the order Guard is a recently established offshoot of the Palace Guard that has merged with the now disbanded city guard. Being the larger but less trained of the two, they handle day-to-day duties in the realm of Dragoness Barony. Protection outside of the city used to be commonplace, but is super-rare and only reserved for nobles who venture beyond the walls.

Since the introduction of Fumyss, the ranks have been reinforced with outsiders and mercenaries. 
### Palace Guard
Led by [[Charles de Dragoness]], the Palace guard is the elite force that protects the Barony's top families, including Dragoness themselves. They are hand-picked from the Order Guard (previously the city guard), and are permanently committed to their duties. Thanks to the Order Guard enforcing almost all laws, and the Palace Guard being mostly relegated to the Bronze Reach and Palace Grounds, they do not see a lot of action, and nepotism is commonplace amongst the ranks for a few years now.

The one exception to all of this is the Border Guard. This section of the Palace Guard is experienced and battle-worn, but also trained to be as unempathetic as can be, as to keep the cities population and labor force within the walls as best they can.
### Dragoness Freedom Legion
The Order Quadrant's militia is the Dragoness Freedom Legion, a decentralized conspiracy of denounced nobility, ex-criminals, and angry citizens in general. Thanks to the iron firs of the Order Guard, they are incapable of using force to counter the oppression of the Barony's nobility. Therefor, most of their actions are swift guerilla-tactics, infiltrations, thefts, and the spreading of propaganda. They are supported by the [[Greyskil Refugee Resistance]].

Though joining the Freedom Legion would seem like a great idea given the climate of the Order Quadrant, their existance is known amongst the public, as well as the Order Guard, meaning anyone even slightly associated with the group is marked as a terrorist. 
# History
The history of Dragoness Barony as a city is extremely short compared to other cities; the lands have been in the hands of [[Dragoness Family]] for multiple generations, but the extreme growth the coastal city has went through (thanks to the unknown 'trade' [[Xavion de Dragoness]] made with [[Kruziik'ahraan]]) is unprecedented, being built from the ground up as a towering city. Its "legend" is that Xavion inherited wealth from an older relative long gone from Geryskil, and used this capital to buy the first stones for the walls of the city. Then, Xavion is said to have charmed both the locals into helping build the city using their own hands and for good pay, as well as [[Gabong]] and [[Yyh'ma]] to guarantee a safer land-route to trade with. Though the second is true, none of the workers that built the city ever saw compensation, being mostly exiled to their old farms, or farms far beyond the current city walls.
