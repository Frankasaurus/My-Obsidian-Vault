# Geography
> TODO: Expand
The Bloeming Isles pride themselves on the fact that they don’t share a border, and none of them live on steady land, living live in between the waves of the near-sacred Inner Marver sea. Of course, any cartographer will point out that they inhabit the town of Kenoa, while the slightly southern Wovens is under control from Orphelica. Next to that, an extremely narrow passage, only a mile or two from Bloeming’s Rest, exists towards Ty’heris. What you can’t take away, however, is their extreme affinity for their water.

What lies below has slowly been uncovered as a collection of shipwrecks, caves, sunken islands, and a small amount of merfolk civilizations.
