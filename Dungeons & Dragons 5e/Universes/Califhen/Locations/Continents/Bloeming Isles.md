The **Bloeming Isles** is the common Califhenic name for the island chains inbetween [[Greyskil]] and [[Drav-Modesta]]. Originally established by pirates, it is currently home to some of the best tradespeople of [[Califhen]].

# Society
The peoples of the Bloeming Isles (denonym: "Rovers") find themselves on the other end of the spectrum compared to their more established and 'civilized' neighbours. The core principle of being a Rover is derived straight from Pirate Codes, though updated slightly to accomodate the minimum requirement of government and structure. To be a Rover comes down to taking care of only yourself and the immediate people around you, by creating your own business for example, leading to many smaller businesses dotting the Isles. In the old days, taking what you want was also a common virtue, but this 'tradition' died down when established families came to settle on the islands, and governance increased. 

Trade has allowed the Isles to be the most diverse nation in [[Califhen]], as well as the most equal; The basis of the Rover's Code does not allow for anything else than a shallow hierarchy. This has the effect of being very appealing to the international audience, in combination with the generally favorable climate. At the same time, the Bloeming Isles are not safe, as justice is mostly left to the populace itself, especially on the open seas. Though this does result in the Rovers being a hardy folk, they also find themselves quickly isolated if they are perceived as weak.

Rovers typically do not differentiate between work and free time, seeing their occupation as a permanent part of their lives. It is down to each individual to create an occupation that statisfies them, and allows them to contribute to their community besides taking care of themselves. This desire to keep the joys of spare time integrated with your occupation is very much derived from sailors not sailing as a pasttime, but as a calling. Hence, it is very natural for the general Rover to switch between doing their job and dancing a jig several times a day. The only exceptions are the many festivals that most of the settlements host nearly every couple of weeks. To outsiders, these are often explained as the Rovers' weekends, during which they get to completely switch off and recharge from their regular singular duty.

Though this has somewhat decreased over the years thanks to diversifying needs, many Rovers see themselves getting sea legs at an extremely young age. Coming to grips with sailing small boats is required in most smaller towns, with a larger 'Lesson Vessel' being a common site in most major port cities. Despite the prominence of sailing, it is common to see nobles neglect their expected duty of growing sea-legs, in favour of more prosperous - and often easier - occupations. Though not a crime, it can often result in alienation or even disdain from general society. There are exceptions to this, however; According to the Rover's Code, if one is perceived to not be born for the Inner Marvers, this expectation is not applied to them. This rule mostly applies to the disabled, but has also been related to especially important occupations such as doctors, carpenters, and bookkeepers, whom must never be shunned if one wishes to keep his purse, walls, or legs in top-shape. 
# Geography
The Isles are often divided into two halves of major geological formations, with the first half being mountaineous volcanic islands. These relatively young landmasses are the main attraction of the Bloeming Isles, and often romanticized internationally, even though there is often not enough arable or even livable terain due to its varying nature. You can find these areas mostly in The Bloeming Heart, consisting of the Jaxos Isles, Becx Isles, and Sosa Isles. 
The second is half is flat continental terain, mainly at Parrot's Overlook in the North, and Kenoa in the South. The waters near these shores are more shallow, allowing for longer beaches with large sandy shores, and significant swamplands. The counterside is that these locations are often less naval-based, requiring long and expensive docks to allow for larger ships to dock.  

Despite these three being very destinct from each other, all of them share a humid and coastal climate, with strong winds and surging water being a primary concern for all settlements, coastal or inland. There are also a smathering of flora and fauna found in the various regions, thanks to the abundance of rain and heat; lush jungles are dotted around the main islands, with especialy Jaxos having some of the densest forests in Califhen. Many a beast also finds its home here.

What lies below the surface of the Bloeming Isles main body of water - the Inner Marvers - has slowly been uncovered as a collection of shipwrecks, caves, sunken islands, and a small amount of Waterfolk civilizations of various sizes. The many coastlines hold some of the largest coral reefs in [[Califhen]], and despite the average depth being relatively shallow, the depths on especially the Western side of the Bloeming Isles can be staggering, and hold some of the largest deep-sea creatures known.
## Infrastructure
All of the Bloeming Isles towns and cities find themselves coastal, though some more 'committed' to the island life than others. The mountaineous, volcanic islands of The Bloeming Heart houses the largest settlements due to its well-protected nature, while the rest of the settled regions reside in smaller, but more arable land. With the exception of Kenoa, many buildings, houses, and structures are built to resist heavy weahter and protected from the surging Inner Marvers, sometimes even built higher up. Its location near the equator also facilitates a hot climate, resulting in often open and 'flowing' infrastructure, making liberal use of old sails to allow for privacy, while still preventing the build-up of humid air.

One thing to note is that the main mode of transportation is by water, and this translates to traversal within settlements. Rivers are quintessential for not only drinking water, but for movement within a city. Cape Rosa is famous for its large branching river 'highway'. In contrast, because of the relative lack of available mounts, as well as the lack of any large-scale land traversal, most paths are build for humanoid traversal. With the exception of goats, most carts are also hauled by humanoids. 
## The Bloeming Heart
Also known as the Jaxos-Becx-Sosa Chain, these are the self-described heart of the Isles, being the most developed and populated areas, and are incredibly diverse due to its relevance in Califhenic trade. Very reliant on internal and external trade for its survival due to the lack of habitable areas.
- [[Cape Rosa]]: Capital, governmental hub, and cultural powerhouse of the Bloeming Isles. Permanent residence is mostly reserved for the wealthy.
- [[Telack]]: One of the few monarchical societies with many old internal struggles, and the main trading hub for [[Drav-Modesta]], overrun with wannabe sailors.
- [[Meqen]]: The origins of the Bloeming Isles, being settled by Henrik Bloeming himself. Nowadays ruled by a 'Noble Pirate Accord', mostly focussed on mining and trade with [[Greyskil]].
- Ayhwen Town: A recent aquisition of the Bloeming Heart, being abandoned by [[Greyskil|Greyskil's]] government, and since self-governing. Famous for its food.
## Parrot's Overlook
This northern region has overall rejected Cape Rosa's traditional government for various, but still cooperates a fair amount. It's also the only land-border the continent has.
- The Perch: A pirate owned settlement, relatively lawless, but consequently quite fair. Currently going through a necessary major policy and industry shift because of its reputation.
- Laketown: One of the biggest farmfishing settlements thanks to its geography and brine salt supply, supplying the majority of Bloeming Isles' exports.
- Bloeming's Rest: An individualistic location, favoring peace and quiet, supplying the Isles' with agrivultural produce. A favorite of retiring sailors, with major aging problem.
## Other
- Kenoa: A shared settlement of [[Orphelica]], though neither commit to maintaining it, which has attempted partition several times. Battle-worn, and squalid.
- Dog's Respite: An old cavern hideout, populated with old pirate families, and thus claimed by the Isles, even though its governed by [[Greyskil]] officials for centuries.
- Amala Laguna: One of the seabottom civilizations of the Waterfolk, serving as a neutral grounds within the waters of Bloeming. Extremely developed, housing many universities.
## Points of Interest
- [[Towers of Stendor]]: An abandoned holy tower to [[Olvex]], which mysteriously teleported itself from [[Orphelica]] to the middle of the Inner Marvers.
- [[Cgorvelon]]: An extinct cult-village of Baghtru on the isle of Tezeder, East of [[Meqen]]. Houses [[Baghtru's Gloves]], the 3rd [[Relic of Terror]].
