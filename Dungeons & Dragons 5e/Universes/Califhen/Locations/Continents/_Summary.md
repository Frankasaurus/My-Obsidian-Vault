## Glossary

Each continent gets divided into subcategories, starting off with a quote and a summary, to give an idea of what the continent consists out of, how it was formed, and what remains of it today.  
After that, the geography will be dealt with, detailing it’s resources, layout, and origin. Landmarks will also be discussed, as will its rivers, lakes, seas, and borders.  
Next up, locations will be describing the numerous villages, towns, cities, and capitals. A detailed description of each of the types will be shown in this table.

|   |   |   |   |   |
|---|---|---|---|---|

|Cities|10.000 – 25.000|A handful of Inns, bars, and taverns support multiple stores, shops, and services.|A garrison of the continent’s army resides within.|A small council or ensemble runs general business.|

History will be handled next, describing the influence the common settlers of the modern world have placed upon the lands, including specific people and groups. If it was a recorded timepiece, a year may even be attached to it. General history of Califhen is handled in the Document “History and Origin of Califhen”.  
Lastly, Relations will be used to described what the continent typically is up to when considering trading, teaming up in times of war, and maybe previous battles they’ve had.
