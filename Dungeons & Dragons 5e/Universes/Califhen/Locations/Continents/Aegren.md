**Aegren** is the common Califhenic name for the Southern polar region. It is home only to creatures that can withstand extreme cold weather conditions, or those in established colonies like its capital, Palacina.

# Society
## Aegren Union
The permanent population of Aegren is the smallest in size of any population in [[Califhen]], and is located almost entirely in one of the three settlements as life outside these settlements is extremely difficult. Even then, these settlements cooperate to make life as bearable as possible despite the freezing temperatures, which is why the **Aegren Union** came to be. The union is comprised of three elected officials - The mayors of [[Palacina]] and [[Sevenkings Outpost]], and the Town Chief of [[Yv Kuy'ivelo]] - whom each vote on matters surrounding trade, warfare, and international cooperation. Other matters such as infrastructure, culture, and education are for the settlements' own government to decide for themselves. The governing body meets once every 50 days, rotating through the settlements' Union Chambers.

The settlements within the Aegren Union have quite severe cultural differences despite the cooperation, mainly caused by the otherwise extreme isolation of the continent. Palacina adopts a very cooperative and trade-focussed culture, with higher diversity and more industry, mostly due to its [[Ordenis]] roots. Sevenkings Outpost, through colonisation by [[Far Kachmer]] is very hierarchical, conservative, and nationalistic, with respect and honesty being the primary virtues. Yv Kuy'ivelo has stuck to its status as Holy Chiefdom, being guided by faith in this barren white wasteland, and rejects modern traditions that would overdevelop the settlement, even though it is the most culture-rich of the three. 
The Union has somewhat encouraged the acceptation of the settlement's differences, though there are many individuals who want to see the union either gone, or in full control.
## White Wilds
Within settlements, it is often said that 'Beyond these walls, there is the Kingdom of Death, with ice as its Queen.'. Indeed, the frozen lands of Aegren pose a threath to most individuals, though there are always those that call it home. Though outnumbered by beasts and animals, the humanoids that call the frozen planes home are known as the **White Wilds**. These self-reliant mini-colonies are often comprised of only a couple of small families, but sometimes even just one or two indivuals. There is no governing body, no structure, and no coherent culture other than survival. The motivations for becoming a White Wilder are also rarely the same, and can be as simple as wanting to get away from at all, to convicted corrupt kings looking to hide from bounty hunters.  
# Geography
The continent only shares one narrow border with Ordenis, and is otherwise surrounded by the Dulithic and the Butaclan Oceans. This border is starts at the smallest point of the passage known as the Iklam, which is slightly due south of the Vingweke river. It is here that the continent grows outwards to a massive white and flat expanse; the only one of its nature, due to the more bumpy and mountainous nature of the other Artic provinces, such as [[Moundaria]] and [[Nizakun]]. It is because of this distinct flatness that almost nothing of interest is found on the continent, which in turn makes it a wide open area for beasts to live and scavenge, without the fear of humanoids hunting them down.  

The two bays it forms on the Eastern and Western side are called the Bay of the Eclipse, and Ducal’s Treasure, respectively. How the bay got its name is lost in time, and gives way to many stories. Ducal used to be a merchant that traveled the treacherous journey around the Tear of Yansic, and somehow always managed to return with goods and wealth. His luck is said the be somewhere in the bay, on the bottom of the ocean, but even the merfolk do not dare to threat below the shores.
## Eclipse Shores
- [[Palacina]]: Also known as the "City of Glass" due to glasslike frost covering almost all of it. It serves as the capital, governmental hub, and houses >80% of Aegren's total population.
## Ducal Shores
- [[Yv Kuy'ivelo]]: The oldest settlement, and a true Chiefdom. Rich in culture, very self-reliant, and sceptical of outsiders.
- [[Sevenkings Outpost]]: An old empirial colony, since abandoned by its colonizers. A meritocracy, exclusively housing intelligent individuals, rapidly developing.
## Points of Interest
- Iklam: The shifting ice-bridge between [[Ordenis]] and Aegren provides the only semi-permanent land bridge, though increasingly difficult to traverse.
# History

For nearly its entire existance, Aegren was void of life, save for the few creatures that are able to withstand its climate. But after the first colonies were established right at the start of the ruler’s era, this shifted, though not very drastically. Its first population centres were given the blessing of the Hero [[Yv Ak’io]], after he sought a place of recluse and recovery from the [[Battle of Souls]], and the region has been relatively stable ever since. Through expansion, Aegren gained a couple of habitable areas, a capital, and a seat in the CASCO Council. It has well and truly finally gotten the recognition it didn’t know it wanted, and it is the continent with the least amount of history written (thus far).

It’s one and only neighbor Ordenis has a very mature sight on Aegren, even though it is one of the youngest continents to inhabit sustained humanoid life. It has sought recognition through offerings of trade to both Ordenis and other continents, and has offered to host many Casco sessions for many decades now. Besides that, all Elven inhabited continents and provinces such as [[Zila]] and [[Orphelica]] will always see the elves of Aegren as their brethren, due to their close connection to [[Yv Ak’io]].
