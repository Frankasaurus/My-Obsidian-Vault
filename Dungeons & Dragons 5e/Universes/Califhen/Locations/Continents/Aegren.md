> *“When I first laid eyes upon the wastes, it looked like the coldest, most baron, distant place in the world. A place where nothing would ever grow or thrive. I loved it…”*  
- Yv Ak’io’s autobiography (around -711)

**Essentially the south pole of Califhen, Aegren was established right at the start of the ruler’s era, after is hadn’t been colonized for almost it’s entire existence. It was given the blessing of the Hero Yv Ak’io, after he sought a place of recluse and recovery from the Battle of Souls, and has been relatively stable ever since. It even gained a couple of habitable areas, a capital, in the form of a port city, and a seat in the CASCO Council. It has well and truly finally gotten the recognition it didn’t know it wanted, and it is the continent with the least amount of history written (thus far).**

### Geography

The continent only shares one narrow border with Ordenis, and is otherwise surrounded by the Dulithic and the Butaclan Oceans. This border is starts at the smallest point of the passage known as the Iklam, which is slightly due South of Vingweke. It is here that the continent grows outwards to a massive white and flat expanse; the only one of its nature, due to the more bumpy and mountainous nature of the other Artic provinces, such as Moundaria and Nizakun. It is because of this distinct flatness that almost nothing of interest is found on the continent, which in turn makes it a wide open area for beasts to live and scavenge, without the fear of humanoids hunting them down.  

The two bays it forms on the Eastern and Western side are called the Bay of the Eclipse, and Ducal’s Treasure, respectively. How the bay got its name is lost in time, and gives way to many stories. Ducal used to be a merchant that traveled the treacherous journey around the Tear of Yansic, and somehow always managed to return with goods and wealth. His luck is said the be somewhere in the bay, on the bottom of the ocean, but even the merfolk do not dare to threat below the shores.
### Locations

Palacina – The City of Glass  
Type: Capital  
Leadership: Board of Noblemen known as “The Watchmen”.  
Only established over the most recent centuries, but still an important city, keeping most of the inhabitants of Aegren in check, and in safety. It has made itself an important town for training of expert craftsman, but also for training, as there are several remnants of the squabbles from the gods millennia ago.

Yv Kuy'ivelo  
Type: Village  
Yv Ak’io’s burial site is not known, but Yv Kuy’ivelo used to be his resting place during his final decades. His home has become a shrine and sanctuary to those that seek his guidance, and it’s essentially where the hero of Yv Ak’io finds his home. Due to its prominence, however, it has gained a lot of attraction from settlers looking for a place down south, and it is in part due to the expansion of Yv Kuy’ivelo that made the small settlement a true village. 

Sevenkings Outpost  
Type: Town  
Initially settled by the first of the kings during the Southern expansion of the Kachmerian League, it was only when all the seven kings invaded at once that the Artic tribes surrendered. It isn’t much beyond a port village nowadays, but it’s architecture still bears much resemblance to how the Kachmerians initially left it.

### History

Aegren has a distinct lack of tracked history, mostly due to the lack of any infrastructure on the continent since it finally settled. The only reason inhabitants started to migrate to the harsh cold climate was in search for any land that hadn’t been claimed yet, mostly in hopes for undiscovered resources. Aegren appears to be mostly stripped of any valuables however, but the City of Glass seems to have found a small exception, finding ice infused elements that can’t be found anywhere else. 

It was only after Yv Ak’io’s migration to the cold continent in -714 that stimulated the migration of many other souls, writing “I have great respect to anyone that wishes to attempt to survive here, and I will bless anyone courageous enough to find a new home in this region.”. Yv Ak’io was a powerful archmage, and had no real trouble staying there himself, but it was his blessing that he was able to expel once he became a Hero that made it possible for people to come here. 

### Relations

It’s one and only neighbor Ordenis has a very mature sight on Aegren, even though it is one of the youngest continents to inhabit sustained humanoid life. It has sought recognition through offerings of trade to both Ordenis and other continents, and has offered to host many Casco sessions for many decades now. Besides that, all Elven inhabited continents and provinces such as Zila and Orphelica will always see the elves of Aegren as their brethren, due to their close connection to Yv Ak’io.
