# Geography
The continent only shares one narrow border with Ordenis, and is otherwise surrounded by the Dulithic and the Butaclan Oceans. This border is starts at the smallest point of the passage known as the Iklam, which is slightly due south of the Vingweke river. It is here that the continent grows outwards to a massive white and flat expanse; the only one of its nature, due to the more bumpy and mountainous nature of the other Artic provinces, such as [[Moundaria]] and [[Nizakun]]. It is because of this distinct flatness that almost nothing of interest is found on the continent, which in turn makes it a wide open area for beasts to live and scavenge, without the fear of humanoids hunting them down.  

The two bays it forms on the Eastern and Western side are called the Bay of the Eclipse, and Ducal’s Treasure, respectively. How the bay got its name is lost in time, and gives way to many stories. Ducal used to be a merchant that traveled the treacherous journey around the Tear of Yansic, and somehow always managed to return with goods and wealth. His luck is said the be somewhere in the bay, on the bottom of the ocean, but even the merfolk do not dare to threat below the shores.

For nearly its entire existance, Aegren was void of life, save for the few creatures that are able to withstand its climate. But after the first colonies were established right at the start of the ruler’s era, this shifted, though not very drastically. Its first population centres were given the blessing of the Hero [[Yv Ak’io]], after he sought a place of recluse and recovery from the [[Battle of Souls]], and the region has been relatively stable ever since. Through expansion, Aegren gained a couple of habitable areas, a capital, and a seat in the CASCO Council. It has well and truly finally gotten the recognition it didn’t know it wanted, and it is the continent with the least amount of history written (thus far).

It’s one and only neighbor Ordenis has a very mature sight on Aegren, even though it is one of the youngest continents to inhabit sustained humanoid life. It has sought recognition through offerings of trade to both Ordenis and other continents, and has offered to host many Casco sessions for many decades now. Besides that, all Elven inhabited continents and provinces such as [[Zila]] and [[Orphelica]] will always see the elves of Aegren as their brethren, due to their close connection to [[Yv Ak’io]].
