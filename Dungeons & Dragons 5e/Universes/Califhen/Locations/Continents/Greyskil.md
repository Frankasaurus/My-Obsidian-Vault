**Greyskil** is the common Califhenic name for the circular landmass inbetween the Dulithic Ocean and several of the largest seas, positioned between [[Ty'heris]] and [[Orphelica]]. It is home to some of the oldest lineages of elves, as well as the largest continuous jungles, forests, lakes, and mountains. It played home to some of the greatest Holy battles between deities, remnants of which are still visible, such as at the massive Courtyard of Deities.
