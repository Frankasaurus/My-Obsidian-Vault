**Loredine** is a Starbeast, whose threat near Dolensong Forest was the final quest of [[Garrick]]'s parents and uncle, Pacper. Long-brewing tensions led to Pacper leaving before the quest started, and the fate of Garrick's parents remained unknown.

Loredine would later be known as **'Her Oracle'**, and captured, then worshipped by [[Gallus]]' tribe over at Camp Aurora. Loredine would be kept higher up the mountain in a secluded clearing within the cliffs, and would foretell the future if one traded crystals with it. It seeks to use specific crystals, known as **Illinum**, to grow in size and strength, to once again roam free. (See [[Black Soup D&D Session 1]]). 

Loredine is ultimately a mythical beast that does not seek destruction, but is territorial and not native to the Material Plane. It can either be set free, ignored, or fought to death, but it will not ally unless forced to. It's current predicament is mostly one of captivity due to wound sustained in the fight with the Gajau hunters.
