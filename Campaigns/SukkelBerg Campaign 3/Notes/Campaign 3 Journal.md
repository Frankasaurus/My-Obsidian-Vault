# First arc setup
The first arc is going to be ~4 Sessions long, and revolve around the party's escape from Cogastr and return to mainland. They will have to...
- Deal with the prison break
- Decide on what destination they want
- Cross the sea, or deal with the ancient temple on the island for a teleporter, or find a way to reach external assistance
- Get back on their feet and re-obtain their items

The hook is going to be either...
- Facing the Leeflin Brut folks chasing them 
- Taking over the island's occupants
