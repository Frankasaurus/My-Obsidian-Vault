# Perpetual goals of campaign 3
## Pillar 1: Narrative
Issues with last campaign: 
- Narrative arcs were **drawn out**
- Arcs included **filler segments** that didnt add to the story
- Players felt both **excluded** or **too much** in the spotlight
- Arcs were made with a **specific player** in mind, and not the party, excluding members
- Lacking **tension** and **hook**
- A bit too **generic**

Goals for this campaign's narrative:
- Present fresh arc's that speak to (a large portion of) the party as a whole
- Cycle through arcs relatively quickly and focussed, at least in the beginning
- Allow players to drive the narrative a LOT more
	- Present open-ended options that do not have an end-scene in mind
	- Allow for moments that do not have fixed solutions
## Pillar 2: Characters
Issues with last campaign: 
- Characters were created with a **short campaign** in mind
- The creation was very open-ended, **without much guidance** from DM
- Backstories were **individualy** created
- Characters weren't **incorporated** into the story
- Nobody was given a clear overarching goal
- A lack of individual **rewards**

Goals for this campaign's characters:
- Add restrictions.
	- Funnel everybodies backstory into 1 similar situation
	- No more across-the-map backstories. You **must** start as a nobody
- Think with the players during creation, especially for long-term progression
- Encourage creating a story together, as we are with a big group
## Pillar 3: World
Issues with last campaign: 
- **Premade** without much wiggle room; **inflexible** to the campaign
- **No** player input in the worldbuilding
- Way overdone and **overpresented**, with a lot of irrelevancies
- Within the campaign, **unvarried**
- Lacked **mysteries**, ended up being very **one-tonal**

Goals for this campaign's world:
