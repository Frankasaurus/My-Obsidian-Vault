Dr. Pivostoli used to be a highly skilled mage, who wore [[Pivostoli's Ring of Preservation]]. When he was assassinated in a political plot, his mind transfered to the ring as he had hoped, but the ring become lost and forgotten about for many years. Andries found it after using arcana to search for it, and found his mind fractured by the lonelyness. Nevertheless, he wanted to use his ring in the [[Tome of the Blooded]] experiment. After this became a failed project, the ring ended up encased on a severed hand for nearly a century, until the [[Party (C3)]] found the book, and released the hand. [[Nyrin]] now is the beared of this ring, and thus hears Pivostoli's remaining sanity in her head.

Ultimate goal here is to grant the party a powerful ally or enemy after his mind has been transfered to a new body, be it an empty corpse or a construct.
