Dr. Pivostoli used to be a highly skilled mage, who wore [[Pivostoli's Ring of Preservation]]. When he was assassinated in a political plot, his mind transfered to the ring as he had hoped, but the ring become lost and forgotten about for many years. Andries found it after using arcana to search for it, and found his mind fractured by the lonelyness. Nevertheless, he wanted to use his ring in the [[Tome of the Blooded]] experiment. After this became a failed project, the ring ended up encased on a severed hand for nearly a century, until the [[Hex Circulum]] found the book, and released the hand. [[Nyrin]] now is the beared of this ring, and thus hears Pivostoli's remaining sanity in her head.

Ultimate goal here is to grant the party a powerful ally or enemy after his mind has been transfered to a new body, be it an empty corpse or a construct.

Pivostoli is slightly learned in other realms, though focussed on Evocation magic, and Psychic alterations.

Pivostoli helped Nyrin and the party with Lenora's questions, but would like something in return. He will request one or two components before dropping the big question (he needs a body: *Lenora can supply him said body in due time*).
1. He wants to calm his nerves, and regain some of his sanity, memories, and conciousness. That way, he is of more use to the party, but can work on his theories in the background. For this, Nyrin has to build him a pocket dimension. She will learn a spell, called "Pivostoli's Mind Palace", which will be a 4th level Enchantment spell, and require a sleeping potion worth 50gp, high quality fabric of pure silk worth 200gp, and a ruby worth 50gp, all of which the spell consumes. This will create a pocket dimension linked to Nyrin's psyche, in which the sleeping souls of individuals can rest. Pivostoli would still require being brought out of the Shadowfel and into the Mind Palace, though.
2. Something else.
3. I need a body.
