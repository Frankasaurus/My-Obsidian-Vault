The Lessonmother is an entity alligned with Null, or the belief that all should return to nothingness. The ultimate goal of her cult is to recruit as many entities alligned with nothingness, and descend upon the realms to relief everything of life and meaning. They are convinced that the entity who created the universe made a mistake, and that shadows and darkness are glimpses at the true reality that the entity wanted to make - hence they are also obessed with dreams and sleep as important rituals and methods of communion.

She leaves Hollow Footsteps in her path, and is known to stalk her recruits for days to exploit them when they are at their weakest.

They tie in to [[Hex Circulum]] due to [[Lenora]]'s ties with a lord of the Shadowfell, Maggoras, whom they've heard of and wish to recruit. In addition, they seek the wisdom from [[Gallus]], as those that peer in darkness can see truth as it was meant to be.
