The Lessonmother is an entity alligned with Null, or the belief that all should return to nothingness. The ultimate goal of her cult is to recruit as many entities alligned with nothingness, and descend upon the realms to relief everything of life and meaning. They are convinced that the entity who created the universe made a mistake, and that shadows and darkness are glimpses at the true reality that the entity wanted to make - hence they are also obessed with dreams and sleep as important rituals and methods of communion.

She leaves Hollow Footsteps in her path, and is known to stalk her recruits for days to exploit them when they are at their weakest.

They tie in to [[Hex Circulum]] due to [[Lenora]]'s ties with a lord of the Shadowfell, Maggoras, whom they've heard of and wish to recruit. In addition, they seek the wisdom from [[Gallus]], as those that peer in darkness can see truth as it was meant to be.

If the party happens to roam the countryside, they might stumble upon similarly dressed individuals, about a dozen of them, all with pale complexity, paintings on the body and face, and wreathed in cloaks. They will be friendly, and invite the party to spend the night with them, as it's safer to do so.
- They're foreigners from the north, on pilgrimage to the Eye of the Gods.
- They earn their money by carrying letters, or sometimes telling stories and the like.

In the night, if a player wanders around, they will notice a footprint appear in front of them. Following this trail will lead them to a conversation with the Lessonmother. She will tell them to not believe the lies that those that oppose her tell, for they are under the illussion that she's out to get them. She will tell them that there are dark forces in the world controlling governments and places of worship that should have long been put to rest. While her goal of restoring the world to it's rightful order is true, though not based in destruction. *Note that this is a lie.*
