# NPC Overview
In [[Campaign 3]], all NPC's are played by [[Alex]], notwithstanding potential exceptions. Not all NPC's are made up by Alex, particularly in cases where they play a major part in player's backstories. Alex might invite the player over in private to request more information, to ensure accurate protrayal.
