# Description
## Appearance
Kaurius is a Male Snow Elf, with a dull and pale skin tone and dark-grey combover haircut. He is often seen wearing a heavy dark coat, and has a destinctive blood-shot eye from a previous incident. His body is on the larger side - especially for an elf. In addition, he has many tattoos, with all except the ones on his face hidden.
## Personality
A perceptive and calm individual, Kaurius is careful to never miss an opportunity to take what he needs. He uses silence as an intimidation technique, and will often abuse anothers' need for public approval to get his way. If this does not work, he has built a reputation of following up on threaths.

Rarely is Kaurius not scheming, and he revels in hiding plans or disguising them in falsehoods. To him, it is a game to trick the public, with politicians being more like jesters on a stage, rather than office-dwelling bureaucrats.
