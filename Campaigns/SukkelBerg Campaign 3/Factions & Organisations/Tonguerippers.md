# Headquarters
Their main entrance sits in Tobol & Byrna's shop, in the middle of the docks of the Craft & Trade District of [[Elivestr]]. This houses beds, planning rooms, a treasury, and further access to the old catacombs under the city. It requires navigating through the shop, down an old well, and past several interconnected sewer pipes. A mazelike tunnel then gives way to a blocked-off entrance under a magical spell. It's passphrase is "In silence, there's silver" in undercommon.

Alongside their main headquarters, the Tonguerippers have four other substations in the city. Some are high up in towers, while others are sheds with false-walls to hide these. The substations are temporary hideouts or rest stops inbetween missions, and contain everything a crew member needs to stay for a few days in case a lead is hot on their trail.
