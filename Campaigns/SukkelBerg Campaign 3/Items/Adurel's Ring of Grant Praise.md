**Adurel's Ring of Grant Praise** is a magical ring formerly attached to the severed hand of Andries Stellard, bound in the [[Tome of the Blooded]]. 
# Description
This ring's emblem contains the symbol of a shattered arrow. 

The ring has 3 charges. When you or a creature you can see within 30 feet of you suffers a critical hit while youâ€™re wearing the ring, you can use your reaction to expend 1 charge to turn the critical hit into a normal hit instead.

The ring regains all expended charges daily at dawn.
