The **Last Godsent** (*NED: 'Laatste Godengericht'*) is a massive Magical Greatsword and Vambrace pairing currently owned by [[Hex Circulum]]. It formerly belonged to former Gajau-hunter and  [[Garrick]]'s uncle, Pacper. It was left in a bog village Southwest of [[Elivestr]] after Pacper's final mission as a hunter.
# Description
This weapon does not deal standard Greatsword damage, though it does retain its properties and mastery. Instead, this weapon deals damage according to the size of the creature, and the amount of consecutive hits the wielder scores. The base damage die can be consulted in the table below. This is then multiplied for every consecutive attack on the same creature, up to a maximum of ==four==. This is reset whenever the wielder receives any damage, the target creature changes in size, or attacks a different creature, even if that attack doesn't result in damage.
==If the wielder manages to reach four consecutive hits in this manner, they can decide make it's next attack a **Rapture Strike**. This strike critical hits on a 18 or higher, and all of its damage becomes Thunder. This ability can only be used once per week.==

| Creature size     | Base damage die |
| ----------------- | --------------- |
| Medium or smaller | ==1d6==         |
| Large             | ==1d8==         |
| Huge              | ==1d10==        |
| Gargantuan        | ==2d6==         |
The type of damage dealt by this weapon will always be magical and slashing, and can never be changed, ==except for the Rapture Strike ability==.

If the weapon and vambrace are ever over 1000ft removed from each other, their coupling shatters, and both become regular items.
# History
The Last Godsent was crafted for one purpose only - to fell the largest of creatures with thunderous consecutive blows, leveraging it's mighty heft to charge the meteorite crystal core's momentum, making every swing lighter, more accurate, and more deadly. It's vambrace with large steel-padded top is used to better control and handle the weapon's grand size, and specifically designed to let the blade both glide with ease, and help bring the blade high above the wielder's posture before striking.
