**Telinde's Bracelet of Void Jumping** is a magical ring formerly attached to the severed hand of Andries Stellard, bound in the [[Tome of the Blooded]]. 
# Description
This bracelet allows the wearer to cast the Blink spell without expending a spell slot. Instead of transporting the caster to the Ethereal plane, they are instead brought to Immateria's Void. While they are there, the can see the outlines of surfaces of the plane they just left as white streaks of light, against a background of stars which illuminate an inky shifting void.

For any rules purposes, the caster is on the Ethereal plane while in the Void.
