# Setup
> Travelers from far and wide looking for contracts to clear isn't a new concept to any of you. You're all adventurers traveling the realm of Califhen looking for monsters to slay, people to save (or rob), treasure to loot, and money to earn. But wherein most of these contracts come from desparate individuals in small cities, for just this once, you've all descended upon a government contract. One that paid well, includes a carriage ride to the destination, and even provides food during your adventure. The job? A dissused mine, abandoned many kingdoms and rulers ago, has recently been uncovered to still contain valuable minerals and resources. Why it was abandoned has been long lost to time, and lone spellunkers often return traumatised by what they see, if they return at all. And so they require professionals - souls willing to face the danger and test their mettle for a bit of coin. And this is where you all start; whether for gold, fame, potential, or just for the thrill of it, your fate is the same, this mine is yours to explore, and yours to face its dangers.

*Allow SHORT intro's - who's in the party.*
Note:
- You have not met the contract's "employer" (only mentioned "by the Magistrate of the City of Elivestr" (ordered by [[Kaurius Krone]])).
- You don't know what dangers you might be facing.
- The mine (known as "Blackbane Mine") was an old Illinum Mine - the material is known for shining bright in darkness, but becoming pitch-black in light.
- The last deposits were retrieved over 30 years ago. No recorded exploring of the mines has taken place since.
- (Check) The latest hearsay was that the mine only fell into dissuse after explosives collapsed a section of the floor near the entrance and it became too dangerous. The new regime wants to re-explore extraction.
# 0. Arrival
Luitenant (Kaleena) Stoyanov - Half-Orc V, King's Guard. Checks everyone's names, informs them that the employer is offering a meal to get everyone energised for the adventure. 

Blackbane Mine:
- A split in the ground and mountain is used as an entrance, with accessible ramps.
- Old wooden huts and sheds outside where material used to be stored.
- Newly set up tents with member's of the king's guard keeping watch.
- Long descent down the cave's mouth into the mountain, with some lit torches lighting the way.
# 1. Social encounter
Broad male Snow Elf, [[Kaurius Krone]] (Duke of [[Elivestr]]), is waiting just past the mine's massive internal processing plant (section within the mine used for loading carts).

**Kaurius:**
- Welcomes the party, introduces himself.
- "We are here, because of this!" Holds up a black gem (Illinum), then removes the torch to make the gem glow.
	- (lie) For the good of the city, we need it.
- (lie) I can assure you the mine is structurally sound.
- My last informant - who is unfortunately missing - last reported the gems looking back at him.
- As part of our Honest Adventuring Initiative, meals are included to boost you up before the adventure.
	- (the meals are enchanted)
- I wish you all te best in your endeavours - please report to us when you've secured the cave.

**Meals:** If they choose to eat it, they'll start to excrete a horrible smell after a small amount of time - supposed to lure the beasts.

**Continuing down the cave:** 
- Degraded tools, abandoned shacks, hollowed out walls.
- Cold comes over you.
- Bats will be flying through the halls, slowly increasing in numbers.
- Large pipes follow the walls (water inside). You can hear them creaking and moaning from the stresses.
# 2. Puzzle
Deeper into the mine, a big reinforced wooden door is locked with chains and a padlock. (Sleight of hand DC 14).

The room will widen to a central hall, but the floor will have collapsed to a lower level 30ft down, submerged in a small layer of water.
- An old rope ladder leads down into the depths. 
- The floor is difficult terrain, made from jagged rocks and pillars, mixed with broken rails, tools, and carts.
- There are three major tunnels leading into the central chamber; one going deeper down straight ahead, one going diagonally up on the right side, and the main entrance they just came from. All are 30ft from the floor.
- The pipes along the tunnel walls end in a half-collapsed machine, slowly leaking water.
	- (Arcana) Arcane powerhammer that can shatter large rocks and break them down. Needs watercooling.
- (Perception) explosives littered on the floor

Once they have descended into the halls; Kaurius will appear at the entrance of the chamber.
- Thanks the players for their noble sacrifice. Once the creature has taken the bait, they'll be given an honored grave in the Elivestr Sanctum.
- Once the creature appears, they'll trigger the rigged explosives from far away to bury the beast for good.
# 3. Combat
- Person matching the description of the informant uncincious hanging from the ceiling wrapped in gems. 

3x Young Illinum Dragon (AC:13 HP:25) [Faerie Dragon youth](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/5194992-faerie-dragon-youth)
## Loot
- Several crystals poking out of the walls. 
- Other various gems worth (4 * 30gp).

# End result:
The party traversed the old mines succesfully uncovering explosives and deadly rocks, but were in the end deceived by Kaurius. He exposed them as bait to either lure or distract the cavern's inhabitants. As they were no trapped on the collapsed floor of the mines, they spotted a way up towards the creature's lair, prepared themselves, and slew three Illinum Dragons. With each death, the ore pulsed heavily, and when the last one fell, they could feel the gems around the sigh a breath of relief, as their light released from their cores.

They confronted Kaurius upstairs again - to everyone's surprise - and though threathened to take his life, were paid handsomely in compensation. They were boarded unto a cart to be rolled back towards the city, to new adventures, now a little more wary of the figures that would hire them...
