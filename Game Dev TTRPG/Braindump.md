Shower thought: a short and sweet, but complex Game Dev Game, played like a TTRPG, but structured as a board game. Each player can create a studio to see who makes the best videogame. Players are presented with all different phases of Video game development, experience hardships along the way, and need to make tough decisions that impact their success, which is ultimately determined by recouperation (the amount of times you've regained your investment).
## Why
For everyone that releases a game, there are hundreds that want to develop games. Whether due to interests, skillset, or time, most folks just don't get around to it, losing out on an important culture that has an extremely high barrier of entry. And though we can't suddenly create games within a couple of hours like we can take pictures with our phones, we can use imagination and a crafty ruleset to deliver the satisfaction all the same.
## Primary setup
The game consists out of four elements:
1. The individual developer(s)
2. The development company
3. The game itself
4. The audience
These elements each have their own unique properties, of which the developers themselves are the most important. The game itself, much like game development, is to make all these elements coalesce at the right time, never focussing on just one thing. 
## Goals
Besides having fun, your main goal is to, essentially, remain solvent. The outcome of your actions, skill, product, and luck will determine your success, both financial and spiritual. Whichever player has the best success, wins.
### Additional goals
When the MVP is settled, there is a huge desire to grow this playset out in both width and depth. For instance, adding more genres, a publisher option
## During the game
The game runs along a development track, counted in Weeks, determined by the length you wish to develop for (though you can change this). A year has 12 months, a month has 4 weeks. Every week, a random event is presented to you, depending on where your game stands
