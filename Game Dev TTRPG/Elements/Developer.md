## Roles
This is by no means an exhaustive list, but since this ruleset is built on Indie game development, we're skipping titles like "junior foliage designer".
- Programmer
	- You can not play this game without having at least one programmer. They are the driving force behind creating your game.
- Designer
	- A great designer helps steer the ship in the right direction, setting things up as much as possible beforehand, so that there is less to decide on-the-fly.
- Artist
	- Your game will need looks at some
- Producer
	- This role is reserved for those that want all the others to just focus on their task. They passively lower risk and increase quality of life company-wide.
	- Instead of one Company Property slot, producers add a number of Company Property slots equal to their Communication and Passion skills combined, divided by half. (for example, if Producer Peter has a C4 and P2, their combined values are 6, resulting in a 3)
