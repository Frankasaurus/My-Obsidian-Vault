# Attributes
- Genre
	- Before starting the development, you must choose what genre your indie game is going to be. The genre will determine the difficulty and duration of development.
- Stability
- Fidelity
- Originality
You'll notice the game is missing an attribute; completeness. To simplify things, completeness is tied to the timeline.
